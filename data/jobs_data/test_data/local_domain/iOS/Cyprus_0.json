We're looking for people that like uncertainty and want to figure out how to do things that haven't been done before. You're a true team player and inherently positive. Where others see problems, you see solutions.\n\nFist-bumps if you have 👊\n• Experience in continuous integration setup and automation\n• Taken part in open-source projects\n• Experience with backend technologies\n\nWhat To Expect From Our Hiring Process\n\nAt Plum, we value a lot the time you devote to the hiring process, this is why we are always trying to make the process as fast and smooth as possible.\n• 30 min.
