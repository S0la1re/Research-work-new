This model also feeds into our secret ingredients for innovation: diversity, flexibility, and close connection. Plus, you'll be welcomed into a diverse and inclusive workforce with a lot of creative energy.\n\nAsk our employees what their favourite thing is about working at IG, and you'll hear an echo of 'our culture'! That's because you can come to work as your authentic self. The things that make you, you - like your ethnicity, sexual orientation, faith, age, gender identity/expression or physical capacity - can bring a fresh perspective or new skill to our business.\n\nThat's why we welcome people from various walks of life; and anyone who wants to help us realise our vision and strategy.\n\nSo, if you're keen to connect with our values, and lead the charge on innovation, you know what to do.\n\nApply now\n\nNumber of openings\n0",
