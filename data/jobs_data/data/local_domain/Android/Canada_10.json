We believe that by offering small businesses in North America a decidedly human payment solution where it is easier to sign up and use while being transparent and affordable, we can empower them to grow and prosper. Simply put, helping small businesses thrive is at the very core of our business model, and we think that’s a great way to do business.\n\nFrom the very start, we knew that we wanted to be different from every payment processor out there. We want the merchants we serve to feel supported and see us as a trusted partner rather than simply just another “cost of doing business.” We are relentless in our pursuit to provide a radically transparent and honest payments solution that flat out saves business owners money, all while treating them like human beings.\n\nTHE POSITION\n\nHelcim is searching for a Senior Software Developer (Mobile Applications - Android) to join the mobile app development team and be responsible for developing the next generation of payments technology.
