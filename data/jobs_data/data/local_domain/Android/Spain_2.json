            "description": "09 - December - 2016\n\nThe Challenge\n\nThe road transportation industry has been stuck in the same way of doing things for the past 30 years, with complex over-the-phone transactions that could be sped up and more efficient using the right technology. Our client is a new European start-up devoted to bringing the road transportation industry to the 21st century. They realised that, despite how present mobile technology is in our day-to-day lives, it hasn't yet reached such a critical industry. Their initial product is a B2B platform to streamline the finding of the right carrier for your freight. You can think of it as an Uber for trucks.\n\nThe team\n• Every one of us has had several start-up experiences and on average we have 10+ years of experience in somehow similar challenges. We know success, we know failure; we've built platforms from scratch, we've dealt with large legacy systems. We care about each other and about the product we're building.\n• Some of the past projects where our engineers have been involved before joining us are: building the billing system for one of the largest telephony operators in Spain, building up and optimising complex marketplaces handling millions of orders a month, building real time video chats, building a global identity provider, improving the garbage collector of the JVM, creating social network libraries even before Facebook existed, building the Eurofighter simulator used to train pilots, building kernel modules to deal with real-time processor allocation, creating NLP algorithms to score user comments and timeline recommendation algorithms, building software to manage a backbone network and dealt with the logistic platform of a big supermarket chain.\n• Investors like our concept and team and we've been quite successful in fundraising and gathering resources to support our future growth.\n\nThe engineering culture\n• We value speed of iteration and best practices and we care about our craft: both our API and key JavaScript code have 100% test coverage, for instance.\n• We get engineers as close to the business problems as possible, so everybody can be involved in product decisions. We have mechanisms to enable anybody in the company to bring their new ideas to decision makers since we believe that innovative ideas come from everywhere.\n\nThe stack\n• We have a decoupled architecture, based on REST APIs and asynchronous services. We work with React in the frontend platforms (customers and admin), native in mobile apps (drivers), Python/Django in the backend and we're currently evaluating Elixir for some services. Our DB is PostgreSQL and the queues run on RabbitMQ.\n• We use a dedicated ERP to avoid reinventing the wheel there and we also have built a DWH/Analytics platform which takes advantage of external solutions.\n\nThe profile\n• You're not afraid of tough challenges, both product-wise and technical, and like to contribute your views.\n• You've built complex apps, apps from scratch, apps alone, apps in a team. You know all the tricks of the trade and are absolutely comfortable developing, testing, deploying and debugging Android apps.\n• You care about both the UX and the technical aspects of an app and follow industry trends and app development innovations.\n• You care about the product you're building and the problem you're solving, not just about the technology you're using. You pride yourself in choosing the best technical solution for a problem by taking all constraints into account.\n• You prefer working in a fast-paced start-up, with quick iterations, changes of direction, tight budgets, and chaos over a hierarchical, well-structured corporation with clear and well-defined assignments, and career paths.\n\nThe offer\n• An office in downtown Madrid (Chamberí).\n• A laid-back culture where everybody is encouraged to participate in discussions and contribute.\n• Opportunities for personal growth and learning (we hold regular tech talks and encourage working on different parts of the platform).\n• Good salaries and stock options packages. We want our engineers to have ownership and participate in company success.\n• Flexible schedule (though no regular remote working since we believe in face-to-face communication).\n\nContact\n\nSebastien Sanz, Ayova Executive Search | sebastien@ayova.com (ref: \"OT1216\")",

Honest.\n\nWe need your expertise to help us do something great for our travellers: make booking stays and journeys more sustainable and straightforward. This involves technical challenges and the latest technology, from machine learning and cloud services to world-class APIs!\n\nAs a Software Engineer in distributed systems, you’ll typically be working in Java or Python, and with a technology stack which includes AWS, Kubernetes, Spark, Airflow, gRPC, New Relic and more. Don’t worry if you’re not familiar with these, though - much more important is your understanding of how to design, build and operate distributed systems at scale, your ability to solve problems collaboratively with your teammates, and your passion to learn. You'll be able to break down problems into bite-size chunks and deliver them with high quality.\n\nWe work as a global team, but in squads of 6 to 12 engineers and using Agile/Lean methodology. We don't need you to know every detail of Scrum or Kanban, but you will be able to support your team in establishing sustainable flow to deliver on your projects together.\n\nSkyscanner is a hybrid working company and most roles can be either Full Time or Part Time. We believe when people meet regularly in person, we are better able to innovate, learn, collaborate and inspire. We ask people to be in the office on average 8 days per month.\n\nAlready a global leader in travel, we want to elevate the way we work to a whole other level. In return, you’ll get meaningful things like medical insurance, headspace subscriptions, a home office allowance and the option to buy more holiday. You’ll have the opportunity to work from any country for 4 weeks a year, and 30 days in our other global offices. Everything, in other words, to help you relax and give your best.\n\nFor more details on Engineering at Skyscanner, check our Engineering Blog and follow Skyscanner Engineering on Twitter.",
