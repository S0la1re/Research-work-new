We have several non-graduates; only some of us studied Computer Science; some of us have worked in huge companies; some have only ever worked in startups; others are former consultants. As long as you enjoy learning new things, we‚Äôd love to talk to you.\n\nMonzo works in small, interdisciplinary teams\n\nWe have around 300 engineers out of roughly 4,500 people in total - and we have big ambitions. There are many interesting challenges ahead, and we're happy for people to move between teams or to specialise, whatever you prefer. As an engineer here you'd be able to work directly with anyone across the company, and we run regular knowledge-sharing sessions so you‚Äôll learn heaps about everything from how banks work to effective communication.\n\nYour day-to-day\n\nWe‚Äôre searching for product-focused Android engineers to evolve our native mobile app. You‚Äôll take pride in building polished user experiences, and you‚Äôll balance the need for well-tested resilient code with moving fast and iterating.\n\nYou‚Äôll be working on a product that is a part of day to day life for more than 11 million people already, and your work here will shape the way that people interact with their finances.\n\nAs an Android Engineer at Monzo you'll work in a small, autonomous product squad alongside iOS Engineers, Backend Engineers, User Researchers, Product Designers, Product Managers, QA Testers, and Data Scientists.\n\nYou and your team will be responsible for an overall company goal, rather than building a specific feature - you'll have the opportunity to have impact on both what we build, and how we build it. Mobile engineers at Monzo work on everything from the personal banking product to customer support tools. We also have a small mobile platform squad dedicated to enabling other engineers to move faster.\n\nEvery week we meet as an Android discipline to discuss tools, techniques, problems we're encountering across the company and work together to improve our codebase and processes.\n\nYou'll report to an engineering manager who will meet with you every 1-2 weeks 1:1. They‚Äôre dedicated to helping you grow and develop as an engineer.\n\nOur Android app\n\nOur app is 100% Kotlin, built using MVVM (Model View ViewModel) and Coordinators, and modularised by product feature.\n\nWe use RxJava, Retrofit and Moshi for API calls and Dagger for dependency injection. We‚Äôre starting to use Coroutines for most new features. Room is our choice for persistence, and we use repositories for interacting with data. We‚Äôve built out our design system with Compose.\n\nWe use GitHub Pull Requests to do code reviews, and write unit tests for our ViewModels, Coordinators, and any other classes which contain logic. We write tests for all of our Compose screens and snapshot test them with Happo. We also use Espresso to test flows, which are executed via our continuous integration system.\n\nWe‚Äôve previously written about building Monzo Chat on Android, which goes into detail on some of these elements.\n\nYou should apply if\n‚Ä¢ You care about the impact your work has on our customers, and optimise for outcomes rather than the number of lines of code you output\n‚Ä¢ You‚Äôre excited about and have experience in programming in Kotlin\n‚Ä¢ You‚Äôve shipped and iterated on at least one app in the Play Store\n‚Ä¢ You have a product mindset: you care about customer outcomes and you want to make data-informed decisions\n‚Ä¢ You love turning excellent design into beautiful products\n‚Ä¢ You‚Äôre comfortable working in a team that deals with ambiguity\n‚Ä¢ You have an understanding computer science principles\n\nThe Interview Process\n\nOur Interview Process Involves Three Main Stages\n‚Ä¢ Initial Call\n‚Ä¢ Take home task or pair coding exercise\n‚Ä¢ Final interview including a system design and a behavioural interview\n\nOur average process takes around 2-3 weeks but we will always work around your availability.\n\nYou will have the chance to speak to our recruitment team at various points during your process but if you do have any specific questions or want to talk through reasonable adjustments ahead of or during application please us at any point on tech-hiring@monzo.com\n\nPlease also use that email to let us know if there's anything we can do to make your application process easier for you, because of disability, neurodiversity or any other personal reason.\n\nThere‚Äôs a detailed blog on the interview process, for extra details, hints and tips.\n\nWhat‚Äôs in it for you\n\nüí∞ ¬£78,000 - ¬£110,000 base salary per year ‚ûï plus stock options + Benefits, we also provide all of our engineers with the latest MacBook Pro.\n\n‚úàÔ∏èWe can help you relocate to the UK\n\n‚úÖWe can sponsor visas.\n\nüìçThis role can be based in our London office, but we're open to distributed working within the UK (with ad hoc meetings in London).\n\n‚è∞ We offer flexible working hours and trust you to work enough hours to do your job well, at times that suit you and your team.\n\nüìö Learning budget of ¬£1,000 a year for books, training courses and conferences\n\n‚ûï And much more, see our full list of benefits here\n\nEqual opportunities for everyone\n\nDiversity and inclusion are a priority for us and we‚Äôre making sure we have lots of support for all of our people to grow at Monzo. At Monzo, we‚Äôre embracing diversity by fostering an inclusive environment for all people to do the best work of their lives with us. This is integral to our mission of making money work for everyone.
