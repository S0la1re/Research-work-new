            "description": "At Qvik, we are elbow-deep in the consultancy business, but above all in the people business. Since 2008, we at have been building mobile experiences for consumers, e.g. in the fields of media, finance, travel and mobility, and retail. We create digital solutions for millions of end users every day by doing design, development and consultation work with our clients. And not just any clients, but the most desirable ones in the consumer market – such as Suunto, Säästöpankki, Oura and Kesko, just to name a few.\n\nOur international community consists of 140+ designers, developers and consultants based in Helsinki and Stockholm. We've been rocking the industry for 16 years now. We are not a typical top-down corporation, but an inclusive work community where individuals can affect how we roll.\n\nAre you the one, a new Qvikie?\n\nAt Qvik, we hire talented people that are more than a pair of coding hands.\n\nThis means that, besides coding amazing software, you have the ability to discuss the best technology choices and solutions with clients, including in the sales phase of a project. We take pride in our work, have the curiosity to take our personal development to the next level, and want to share our know-how with our colleagues. We want to see the same kind of spark in you.\n\nBut let's talk about tech. Modestly put, we offer the best possible tech solutions for our B2C customers' needs. To be able to contribute to this, your tech skills should heavily rely on:\n\nSwift / Objective-C and/or Kotlin\n\nAlso experience with cross-platform technologies such as Flutter or React Native is considered a plus.\n\nExperience in any other languages, platforms, technologies or environments are a definite plus for you as a future Qvikie. Responsive design and native apps are the things that make you tick. Any apps already in the store will show a good case for your experience. Seniority in leading projects, mastering agile methodologies, and passion for solving multifaceted tech problems is a definite plus. You probably have comprehensive knowledge in a couple of the mentioned languages and frameworks but, more importantly, you have an interest in learning new ones too.Currently, we are searching for pros who are located in Finland, Uusimaa and are comfortable working in Finnish alongside English.\n\nThe people you work with will be from different backgrounds and have different strengths. This means that we cherish a culture of open-mindedness, equality and empathy toward all people. At the moment, we are reinventing our DEI practices on the company level to make Qvik the best place to work for everyone – but there’s always more work to be done, and we hope that you want to be a part of it.\n\nOh, those projects\n\nAt Qvik, you'll be working in small and autonomous tech teams. Our projects are typically a combination of application and web design and development (hybrid or native), and some APIs in the backend.\n\nYou work in our customers’ development teams, usually together with other Qvikies. The end products you are working with are something you can show to your family and friends – products you can and want to use yourself. We don’t deliver off-the-shelf tricks, but build new solutions from scratch to fit our customers' demands. So you will usually work with cutting-edge software and not so much with legacy – what could be better than that!\n\nOur offer\n\nWe want to care more. We are concentrating on creating an even more inspiring and safe culture, learning by doing, deepening our professionalism, and building an even stronger community.\n\nThe salary level in this position will be somewhere between 5,000 –6,500 €/month + bonuses.\n\nOur basic benefits package is also pretty nice: lunch, commuter, culture and sports benefits, and a bike benefit. Obviously, we provide you with the tools of your choice. We also offer occupational health care with extra health insurance, travel and accident insurance and many company-supported sports and hobby opportunities with other Qvikies.\n\nSupporting the Qvikies' health and work-life balance is essential for us. We offer a sick-child care service for smoother sailing over the flu season, as well as personal support for life challenges via the Auntie service. And don't forget the community glue, aka parties – we are pretty good at setting up some jams, too :)\n\nIn addition, we offer our low-hierarchy culture; flexible working hours; opportunities to try, fail and succeed; as well as a chance for you to concentrate on your actual work. Because that's what you are coming here to do, right?\n\nOK, what next?\n\nIf you want to know more about who you'd be working with and how your days would look like at Qvik, get in touch with our technical recruiters: Olivia (olivia@qvik.fi) or Mariella (mariella@qvik.fi).\n• Please apply through our recruitment system to ensure that all personal information is processed appropriately.",
