The ideal candidate will possess a BS/MS degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or a related field, along with a minimum of 5 years of professional experience in full stack software development. This role requires hands-on coding experience and a strong background in building consumer-facing applications, particularly in the ecommerce or retail shopping sectors. As an Android Developer, you will be responsible for designing and developing advanced applications for the Android platform. You will work collaboratively with cross-functional teams to define, design, and ship new features, ensuring that applications are robust, user-friendly, and performant. Your expertise in unit testing will be crucial for maintaining code quality, including edge cases and usability considerations. You will also be expected to continuously discover, evaluate, and implement new technologies to maximize development efficiency. In this role, you will have the opportunity to work with various data sources and APIs, and you will be involved in bug fixing and improving application performance. Your experience with the agile methodology, particularly Scrum, will be essential as you operate in a fast-paced environment. You will also be responsible for translating wireframes into pixel-perfect views and ensuring that the applications you develop are visually appealing and functionally sound. Additionally, familiarity with animation and screen transitions will be beneficial.
