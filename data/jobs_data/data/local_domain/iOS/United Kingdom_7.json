We’ve got 12 million customers across the globe and we’re growing. Fast.\n\nCurrent banking systems don't let us send, spend or receive money across borders easily. Or quickly.

We are rapidly growing our offering and are looking for someone to join our team. We have recently launched receiving money by payment links and have plenty of exciting projects in the pipeline.\n\nAs well as being an integrated part of a product team, you will get the opportunity to work across the receive squad, so you will get the chance to learn about many parts of the wider Wise product.\n\nWhat does it take?.\n• A passion for technology, product and user experience\n• A broad understanding of the concept of MVP (minimum viable product) and conversion rates\n• The ability to work independently and plan your own solutions to problems\n• Thinking from the customer perspective and putting them at the heart of everything you do\n\nIs that you?\n• Experience with building iOS apps that delight users\n• A passion for product quality and user experience, attention to detail\n• Knowledgeable about product engineering (or have the desire to learn it)\n• Ability to both collaborate effectively across teams and solve problems independently and proactively\n• Great communication skills and the ability to articulate complex, technical concepts to non-technical audiences\n• Full-stack iOS development (we work in small teams, each with one or two mobile engineers, so you’ll be in charge of a feature from API to UI)\n• Know SOLID ways to implement clean architecture, writing readable code that is testable (we currently work with VIPER but are continuously evaluating the latest architectures/methodologies - SwiftUI and Combine are nice to have)\n• We value experience with state-of-art technologies, but we value eagerness to learn them even more\n\nWhat does success look like?\n• You’ll understand our customers and drive the growth of our mobile users\n• You’ll be building new tools for customers so they can resolve payments without contacting us\n• You’ll be helping us ensure reliability of our app\n• You’ll be working to reduce the number of contacts to our customer support due to app problems\n• You’ll have onboarded and found your place through understanding your team and tribe vision and how you can contribute\n\nWhat you get back:\n• The autonomy to solve problems your way\n• The freedom to have real impact\n• Loads of development opportunities\n• A fun work environment with social activities and events\n\nFind out more about our benefits in our London office.\n\nInterested?
