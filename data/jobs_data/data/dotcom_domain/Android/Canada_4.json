We’re looking for a developer handy in C++ and Kotlin to improve Transit on Android. We’ve just started the migration from RxJava to Kotlin Flows, and we’re actively working on our first big Compose screen.\n\nWhile our iOS devs are busy on Notch Island dancing under a Lightning cable (or however else they spend their time) you’ll be optimizing our Android performance, developing better logic, and improving the C++ library shared by our iOS and Android apps. We work natively on Transit’s UI to keep it true to each platform, but there are lots of areas where we can reduce code duplication, making Transit as small and nimble as it can possibly be.\n\nWho are you? You know the ins-and-outs of the Android SDK like a Kotlin-savvy surgeon. The scariest episode of Fear Factor you’ve ever watched didn’t involve eating bugs — but refactoring bug-prone architecture. When your therapist asks what would make you happy, you say “a better Google Maps SDK” three times out loud.\n\nResponsibilities\n\nCollaborate with all-star teammates to dream up Transit’s next big feature.\n\nDevelop those features, refine existing ones, and maintain the Android app with your tender love and care.\n\nRefactor and refine Transit’s architecture to make maintenance simpler to carry out, and new features more-easily integrated.\n\nConspire with our design team priests to bring their vision (and yours) to pixel-plated perfection.\n\n✅ Requirements\n\nGood knowledge of Kotlin and C++.\n\nYou know your way around Android Studio and are detail oriented.\n\nConversational skills in French (and ideally, English).",
