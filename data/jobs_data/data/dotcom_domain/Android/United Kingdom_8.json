You know it takes a mix of people to do amazing work, so you love collaborating with and learning from people with different skills, backgrounds and perspectives. If you have an interesting or unusual mix of skills yourself, even better.\n\nAs a Senior Android Developer, certain essential professional experiences and skills are typically required:\n• Extensive experience in Kotlin is crucial, as it's the primary language for modern Android development. Knowledge of Java is also beneficial for maintaining and updating legacy code.\n• Deep familiarity with the Android SDK and its components, including different versions and how to deal with different screen sizes.\n• Experience with Android Frameworks: Knowledge of core Android frameworks like Android Jetpack, including components like Room, LiveData, ViewModel, WorkManager, Navigation and Compose.\n• Understanding of Material Design principles and ability to create user-friendly, accessible, and responsive interfaces.\n• Proficiency in integrating third-party APIs and understanding networking concepts, including RESTful services and handling JSON/XML.\n• Understanding the full lifecycle of Android apps, from initial design and development to deployment on the Google Play Store and ongoing maintenance.\n• Experience with version control systems, particularly Git, for managing code changes in a collaborative environment.\n• Proficiency in writing and maintaining unit and instrumentation tests, and debugging complex issues using tools like Android Studio Debugger.\n• Skills in optimizing app performance and memory usage, understanding threading, and avoiding common pitfalls in Android development.\n• Knowledge of Android security features and best practices to protect sensitive user data.\n• Staying updated with the latest trends and advancements in Android development, new programming languages, and emerging technologies.\n• Strong communication skills for effectively collaborating with cross-functional teams, including designers, product managers, and other stakeholders.\n• As a senior role, the ability to lead projects, mentor junior developers, and contribute to architectural decisions.\n• Familiarity with architectural patterns like MVP, MVVM, and Clean Architecture.\n• Experience with advanced features like animations, custom views, and sensors can be beneficial.\n\nHaving a portfolio of developed apps available on the Google Play Store, along with a track record of solving real-world problems through application development, can further strengthen a Senior Android Developer’s profile.\n\nConnect to your business - Technology and Transformation\n\nDistinctive thinking, deep expertise, innovation and collaborative working.

For example, through commerce, customer design and sales services.\n\nPersonal independence\n\nRegulation and controls are standard practice in our industry and Deloitte is no exception. These controls provide important legal protection for both you and the firm. We are subject to a number of audit regulations, one of which requires that certain colleagues abide by specific personal independence constraints (e.g., in relation to any financial interests and employment relationships). This can mean that you and your \"Immediate Family Members\" are not permitted to hold certain financial interests (shares, funds, bonds etc.) with audit clients of the firm, and also prohibitions on certain employment relationships (e.g., you are not permitted to hold a secondary employment role with SEC audit clients of the firm whilst being employed by the firm). The recruitment team will provide further detail as you progress through the recruitment process or you can contact the Independence team upon request.\n\nConnect with your colleagues\n\n“What attracted me to Deloitte were the endless opportunities and the collective experience of other like-minded individuals. Deloitte’s clients include many of the world’s largest organisations; I wanted to be part of a team that made a difference that I could be proud of.”\n• Dan, T&T\n\n\"I get to work on projects that help clients in a sector I feel truly passionate about.”\n• Rhiannon, T&T\n\n“Everyone always says “it’s the people,” and that’s true. Working for a brand you feel proud of feels pretty good too. And you don’t have any stress about fitting into a particular stereotype, because there are so many different types of people in Deloitte Digital.”\n• Gillian, T&T\n\nOur hybrid working policy\n\nYou’ll be based in Manchester with hybrid working.\n\nAt Deloitte we understand the importance of balancing your career alongside your home life. That’s why we’ll support you to work flexibly through our hybrid working policy. Depending on the requirements of your role, you’ll have the opportunity to work in your local office, virtual collaboration spaces, client sites and remotely. You’ll get the chance to meet face to face when needed, while you collaborate and learn from colleagues, share your experiences, and build the relationships that will fuel your career and prioritise your wellbeing. Please check with your recruiter for the specific working requirements that may apply for your role.\n\nConnect to your return to work opportunity\n\nAre you looking to return to the workplace after an extended career break?\n\nFor this role we can offer coaching and support designed for returners to refresh your knowledge and skills, and help your transition back into the workplace after a career break of two years or more.

You'll be encouraged to learn on the job, and we have two dedicated days at the end of our sprints for people to explore, learn and be creative.\n\nInterview process:We know that interviewing is a two-way process, and we want you to have the time and opportunity to get to know us as much as we are getting to know you!\n\nOur interviews are conversational, and we want to get the best from you, so come with questions and be curious.
