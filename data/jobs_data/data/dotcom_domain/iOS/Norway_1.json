            "description": "About us:\n\nRevenueCat makes building, analyzing, and growing mobile subscriptions easy. We launched as part of Y Combinator's summer 2018 batch and today are handling more than $4B of in-app purchases annually across thousands of apps.\n\nWe are a mission driven, remote-first company that is building the standard for mobile subscription infrastructure. Top apps like ChatGPT, VSCO, Notion, and ClassDojo count on RevenueCat to power their subscriptions at scale.\n\nOur 80 team members (and growing!) are located all over the world, from San Francisco to Madrid to Taipei. We're a close-knit, product-driven team, and we strive to live our core values: Customer Obsession, Always Be Shipping, Own It, and Balance.\n\nThe Role\n\nIf you’re looking to jumpstart your career in tech and have a direct impact on apps used by billions of end-users, the Developer Support Engineer (DSE) role at RevenueCat is a fantastic opportunity. This is one of the few entry-level positions we offer, and it has proven to be an incredible stepping stone—our current Support Lead, a Product Manager, and a Technical Account Manager each started out as DSEs.\n\nIn this role, you’ll help developers integrate the RevenueCat SDK into their apps, troubleshoot tricky edge cases, and unlock new possibilities in subscription monetization. You’ll provide hands-on support for some of the biggest apps in the world—imagine helping the teams behind ChatGPT, VSCO, PhotoRoom, Notion, and others get the best out of RevenueCat. You’ll be empowered to own the support experience, build out internal tools, and identify improvements that shape how developers everywhere use RevenueCat.\n\nIn 2024, our DSEs spoke at conferences in Berlin, Logroño, New York, London, and Tokyo. This is optional, but if you're interested, you can meet RevenueCat customers face to face, have fun working our booth, and share your knowledge with developers worldwide.\n\nWhat you’ll be responsible for\n• Supporting developers daily. You’ll debug issues, untangle complex code paths, and guide developers through onboarding so they can ship subscription features confidently.\n• Collaborating cross-functionally. You’ll partner closely with Engineering and Product to influence the developer experience—everything from our documentation to new features.\n• Building tooling and processes. You’ll craft or improve the internal apps and dashboards that make troubleshooting faster and easier, both for you and your teammates.\n• Driving user success. From investigating stack traces to clarifying best practices, you’ll ensure developers can move from “blocked” to “shipped” without missing a beat.\n\nWithin your first month, you’ll:\n• Deep-dive into the frustrations and roadblocks developers face, helping them get unblocked so they can launch their apps.\n• Familiarize yourself with our support tools and processes.\n• Propose and implement quick wins in our documentation and support articles to reduce common developer pitfalls.\n• Work alongside our engineering team to resolve complex issues and learn the ins and outs of subscription infrastructure.\n\nWithin your first 3 months, you’ll:\n• Spot opportunities for product improvements that will reduce developer friction.\n• Build out test apps and reproducible environments to tackle issues head-on.\n• Own onboarding and solution engineering for new developers using RevenueCat, providing a seamless start-to-finish experience.\n\nWithin your first 6 months, you’ll:\n• Identify recurring blockers and implement targeted improvements—both in our products and in your own support workflows.\n• Craft (and refine) internal dashboards and tooling that accelerate the DSE team’s efficiency.\n• Make meaningful, self-directed contributions to how we scale support for an ever-growing developer community.\n\nAfter 12 months, you’ll have:\n• Gained super-hero level intuition for diagnosing the root causes of even the trickiest tickets.\n• Led the charge on hiring, mentoring, and growing our support engineering team.\n• Found new ways to delight developers, turning frustrating subscription problems into smooth, joyful experiences.\n\nAbout you\n• You’re eager to learn and grow; this is one of the few entry-level positions at RevenueCat and has historically launched multiple careers within our company.\n• You have 2-3 years of experience in an engineering or technical role, or have built and shipped a mobile app that integrates RevenueCat.\n• You’re comfortable with either iOS (Swift / Objective-C) or Android (Java / Kotlin) and have a grasp of app development and release processes.\n• You can debug code with minimal info, diagnosing issues from cryptic logs or stack traces.\n• You thrive in an environment that requires creative problem-solving and a “get it done” mentality.\n• You have strong written and verbal communication skills, and you’re empathetic towards the developer journey.\n\nWhat you’ll need to be successful\n• Technical curiosity and a willingness to learn new tools and frameworks.\n• Resourcefulness in figuring out solutions when the path isn’t obvious.\n• Clear communication skills to translate complex issues into helpful, actionable steps.\n• Outcome-oriented mindset, ensuring your support leads to measurable developer success—fewer tickets, better documentation, and happier customers.\n• Collaboration and comfort with a fully remote, asynchronous setup using tools like Slack, Zoom, Linear, and Notion.\n\nWhat we offer:\n• $112,000 USD Salary regardless of your location\n• Competitive equity in a fast-growing, Series B startup backed by top tier investors including Y Combinator\n• 10 year window to exercise vested equity options\n• Fully remote work environment that promotes autonomy and flexibility\n• Suggested 4 to 5 weeks time off to recharge and focus on mental, physical, and emotional health\n• $2,000 USD to build your personal workspace\n• $1,000 USD annual stipend for your continuous learning and growth\n\nCurious about the interview process?

            "description": "This a Full Remote job, the offer is available from: United States, EMEA\n\nAbout us:\n\nRevenueCat makes building, analyzing, and growing mobile subscriptions easy. We launched as part of Y Combinator's summer 2018 batch and today are handling more than $4B of in-app purchases annually across thousands of apps.\n\nWe are a mission driven, remote-first company that is building the standard for mobile subscription infrastructure. Top apps like VSCO, Notion, and ClassDojo count on RevenueCat to power their subscriptions at scale.\n\nOur 80 team members (and growing!) are located all over the world, from San Francisco to Madrid to Taipei. We're a close-knit, product-driven team, and we strive to live our core values: Customer Obsession, Always Be Shipping, Own It, and Balance.\n\nThe Role\n\nRevenueCat helps apps of all shapes and sizes make more money across mobile, the web, and other platforms like Roku and Amazon. As a result, many different types of users log in to – and use – RevenueCat on a day-to-day basis. Product managers, support reps, lifecycle marketers, user acquisition specialists, data analysts, executives: The list goes on.\n\nNone of those users would make it onto RevenueCat unless a developer implements it first. And for smaller apps, developers are these users: They do the marketing, provide support, interpret the performance data, make pricing and packaging decisions, and more.\n\nWe’re looking for a Senior Developer Advocate to help ensure these developers are successful when using RevenueCat. You’d join forces with our current Advocate, and guy you might have seen walking around Seoul in the rain, Charlie Chapman. We’re specifically looking for someone with strong skills in producing written educational content targeted at developers that is technical but engaging. Your work will educate existing RevenueCat users, attract new search traffic, and position RevenueCat as the go-to resource when implementing in-app purchases across platforms.\n\nWhat you’ll be responsible for\n\nYour primary responsibility will be creating high-quality, developer-focused content focused on monetization and in-app purchases. This includes both scenarios where developers use RevenueCat to solve for these use cases, as well as alternative implementations.\n\nExamples of the type of content we’d expect you to produce include blogpost with titles like:\n• \"Migrating a native subscription app to Flutter: A step by step plan\"\n• \"Implementing your first subscription with RevenueCat: Disable ads for paid users\"\n• \"How to detect and highlight the platform of purchase for cross-device subscribers\"\n• \"Adding a multi-tier subscription to your Expo app\"\n\nIn addition to writing, you’ll:\n• Speak at conferences, webinars, and other events to share insights and represent RevenueCat\n• Record videos and collaborate on webinars to help developers implement and succeed with RevenueCat\n• Work cross-functionally to develop resources that support developers using RevenueCat\n\nWithin the first month, you’ll:\n• Learn RevenueCat inside and out\n• Familiarize yourself with our developer community and how to engage them\n• Have produced your first pieces of RevenueCat content\n\nWithin the first 3 months, you’ll:\n• Collaborate with Charlie on a joint content strategy playing to both your strengths\n• Independently research and develop content to fill current gaps in our documentation and other educational efforts\n• Repurpose existing content into new formats (e.g., blog posts into videos) to expand our reach\n\nWithin the first 6 months, you’ll:\n• Represent RevenueCat at industry conferences and webinars, delivering talks and engaging with developers\n• Support product launches with technical content (written or video)\n\nAfter 12 months, you’ll have:\n• Become a fixture across the developer community, having become synonymous with RevenueCat and in-app monetization for Android, Flutter, and/or React Native\n• Found new and novel ways to help us engage developers (think Shipaton, App Store Rejection socks, and similar initiatives)\n\nAbout you\n\nYou’re passionate about teaching and helping developers thrive. You’re deeply experienced in app development, particularly subscription apps, whether as part of a team or through indie projects (preferably both).\n\nWhat you’ll need to be successful\n• 5+ years of experience in app development or developer-focused roles, ideally in a subscription app environment, with a deep understanding of at least one major mobile development platform (Android, Flutter, React Native preferred; iOS a strong alternative) and the ability to learn and write about others\n• Strong independent project management skills, with the ability to manage multiple content initiatives, events, and deadlines across time zones without constant oversight\n• Excellent technical communication skills, capable of translating complex technical concepts into accessible and engaging written, video, and spoken formats for developers\n• A passion for teaching and empowering developers, with the ability to create content that educates and inspires action, including blog posts, tutorials, and videos\n• Proven ability to learn and explain new technologies, with expertise in Android development, Flutter, or React Native preferred (experience with iOS development is a plus if paired with a demonstrated ability to adapt to and write about other platforms)\n• Proven experience in producing content for a developer audience, preferably in a professional capacity as a developer advocate, but we’d consider exceptional candidates that have written, recorded video, and have spoken at conferences targeted at developers as a hobby or side-project\n• Resourcefulness and adaptability, with a problem-solving mindset to navigate the challenges of engaging a global developer community\n• Outcome-driven approach, ensuring your efforts lead to measurable impacts, such as increased content engagement, developer onboarding, and community growth\n• Comfort with a fully remote, asynchronous work environment, and tools like Notion, Zoom, Slack, and Linear. You’ll need to thrive in an environment that balances collaboration with ample time for focused, deep work\n\nWe’re looking for someone who embodies our team’s core values of agency and intellectual curiosity: taking initiative, solving problems, and continually learning to better serve our diverse developer audience. Regular travel may occasionally be required for conferences, events, or team gatherings.\n\nWhat we offer:\n• $212,000 USD salary, regardless of location\n• Competitive equity in a fast-growing, Series C startup backed by top-tier investors, including Y Combinator\n• 10-year window to exercise vested equity options\n• Fully remote and flexible work environment\n• 4-5 weeks of suggested time off annually for mental, physical, and emotional recharge\n• $2,000 USD for workspace setup and $1,000 USD annual stipend for continuous learning\n\nCurious about the interview process? Discover more in our blog post about how we hire and learn tips to help you succeed.\n\nThis offer from \"RevenueCat\" has been enriched by Jobgether.com and got a 90% flex score.",
