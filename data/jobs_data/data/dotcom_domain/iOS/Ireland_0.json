            "description": "Summary\n\nYelp engineering culture is driven by our values: we’re a cooperative team that values individual authenticity and encourages creative solutions to problems. All new engineers deploy working code their first week, and we strive to broaden individual impact with support from managers, mentors, and teams. At the end of the day, we’re all about helping our users, growing as engineers, and having fun in a collaborative environment.\n\nNo app is better suited for mobile than Yelp. When local content meets location-aware devices that go everywhere with us, Yelp connects with great local businesses right around the corner and lets you instantly share the experience to help the next person discover it, too. It’s no wonder there are over 30 million users of our apps each month!\n\nThe Search UX Mobile team is at the forefront of enhancing the user experience on the Search screen for both iOS and Android platforms, while also overseeing its essential client-side and backend infrastructure.The Search screen is at the core of Yelp’s product, being one of our highest traffic screens, and engineers on the Search UX Mobile team make changes every day that affect virtually 100% of Yelp’s userbase. To build seamless, engaging Search experiences, engineers not only write code but also collaborate with Designers, Product Managers, Data Scientists, and other teams across the company.\n\nOur relatively small iOS community has had a massive impact on the lives of millions, reaching users from around the globe and helping small business owners engage with their customers and build better connections. Yelp has always been on the cutting edge of iOS. From launching our consumer app over 10 years ago, to more recently introducing our business owners app, we continue pushing the envelope of what’s possible on iOS.\n\nThis opportunity requires you to be located in the Republic of Ireland. We’d love to have you apply, even if you don’t feel you meet every single requirement in this posting. At Yelp, we’re looking for great people, not just those who simply check off all the boxes.\n\nWhat you'll do:\n• Build new features in the Yelp app to connect people with great local businesses.\n• Improve and iterate on existing functionality to reliably give our users a smooth experience.\n• Continue to learn, grow, and help us take on brand new challenges.\n• Be a key part of the larger iOS developer community at Yelp.\n\nWhat it takes to succeed:\n• Experience with the iOS platform (Swift).\n• Comfortable working with Mobile Backend engineers.\n• Experience with iOS testing, from breaking controller logic into unit-testable pieces to automated UI testing.\n• An eagerness to embrace scalability, reliability, and performance challenges.\n\nWhat you'll get:\n• Full responsibility for projects from day one, a collaborative team, and a dynamic work environment.\n• Competitive salary, a pension scheme, and an optional employee stock purchase plan.\n• 25 days paid holiday (rising to 29 with service), plus one floating holiday.\n• €150 monthly reimbursement to help cover remote working expenses.\n• €95 caregiver reimbursement to support dependent care for families.\n• Private health insurance, including dental and vision.\n• Flexible working hours and meeting-free Wednesdays.\n• Regular 3-day Hackathons, bi-weekly learning groups, and productivity spending to support and encourage your career growth.\n• Opportunities to participate in digital events and conferences.\n• €95 per month to use toward qualifying wellness expenses.\n• Quarterly team offsites.\n\nClosing\n\nYelp values diversity. We’re proud to be an equal opportunity employer and consider qualified applicants without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, ancestry, age, genetic information, sexual orientation, gender identity, marital or family status, veteran status, medical condition, disability, or any other protected status.\n\nNote: Yelp does not accept agency resumes. Please do not forward resumes to any recruiting alias or employee. Yelp is not responsible for any fees related to unsolicited resumes.\n\n#LI-Remote\n\nRecruiting and Applicant Privacy Notice",
