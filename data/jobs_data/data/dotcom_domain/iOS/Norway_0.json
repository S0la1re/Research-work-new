But do you have any idea how powerful you are with your programming skills and that you can use them to literally make this world a better place?\n\nIn ACT, we have developed a scalable mobile marketplace for sustainable grocery shopping, which will empower consumers to start shopping sustainably almost overnight with the ACT app, changing the direction of their combined purchasing power towards producers who respect the environment and treat their workers well.\n\nIf your eyes widened and lit up a bit, read on!\n\nWhat would be my role in ACT?\n\nLead, develop and build applications for the iOS platform\n\nEnsure the performance, quality, and responsiveness of applications\n\nCollaborate with a team to define, design, and release new features\n\nIntegration of user-facing elements developed with server-side logic\n\nIdentify and correct bottlenecks and fix bugs\n\nMaintain code quality, organization, and automation\n\nWhat skills do I need to accomplish this?\n\n3+ years of experience building iOS mobile products including submitting previously approved products in iTunes App Store\n\nTDD, CI, CD\n\nScrum-based development\n\niOS UI design principles, patterns, and best practices\n\nPlus with experience in:\n\nWhat apps can do and what can happen if they become life integrated tools\n\niOS development on different screen sizes, (different mobile and tablet sizes)\n\nOffline storage, threading, and performance tuning\n\nOpen-source iOS ecosystem and the libraries available for common tasks\n\nCloud message APIs and push notifications\n\nWhy is working with ACT so awesome?\n\nFor countless reasons, but let’s just name three of them:\n\nJoining our team at the beginning of a fascinating journey means you’d simply have a say in what we do and how we do it and take ownership.\n\nAt the same time, you will get constant support, working hand in hand with our diverse and competent team.\n\nAnd above all, you’d play a crucial role in the emergence of (possibly) the only tool that can realistically impact the future of the food production industry and thus mitigate global warming and change the lives of millions for the better.\n• Why am I your ideal iOS Developer? *\n\nGood collaboration skills in an international team\n\nDisciplined and self-driven (it’s not easy to come back from work and work again!), honest and generally good-hearted as hell (...)\n\nA team player building effective and fun relations with other people of diverse backgrounds, even when they’re on the other side of the Earth (or screen)\n\nEnjoying remote work and flexibility of time and location\n\nFluent in English\n\nAble to pay your bills and have a decent life with current stable job and devote at least 10 hours per week to ACT project. For the first period we are paying in shares/equity and we are aiming for a salary paid in cash.\n\nWhat is your gut telling you?\n\nWe know this offer may be peculiar and the no-money-yet aspect can be tough. We’ve all been there, and yet there we are around 20(!) people literally infected with ACT’s vision (we are now fairly close to launch of a pivot launch of backend and frontend, very interesing developer challenges ahead). If your heart (or gut) tells you “I want to be the next ACTer, I want to have my share (metaphorically and literally!) in this world-changing project” there’s nothing left but send us an email to jobs@aacct.org, tell us what your heart told you about working with ACT and share your skills and portfolio to prove that you not only want, but also can.\n\nYou cannot imagine how much we’re looking forward to meeting you :)\n\nCheers,\n\nACT Team",
