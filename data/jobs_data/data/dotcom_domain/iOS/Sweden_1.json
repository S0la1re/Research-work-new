Your technical expertise, combined with a drive for setting new standards, will play a key role in our mission to redefine gaming on Apple platforms.\nWho we are\n\nResolution Games is about more than just creating incredible games. We create virtual games that have real impacts on real people by connecting friends new and old all over the world, allowing them to get out of their seats and move around and engage in real adventures of all kinds.\n\nThe studio’s titles across existing and emerging platforms, from PC to XR, rank among the top-rated and most downloaded games in the space and illustrate the innovative and immersive ways the studio is constantly pushing the boundaries of what is possible. The work that we do in our games like Demeo, Game Room, Racket Club, Ultimechs, Blaston, Bait!, Acron: Attack of the Squirrels! and Cook-Out: A Sandwich Tale drive real innovations that are clearing the path for novel XR use cases.\n\nWe are looking for someone who wants a unique opportunity and enjoys collaborating.

Last but not least, we want those of you who are not just skilled but also a great addition to the team. That is because we believe in team over the individual, a great mix of freedom with responsibility, and that people should always come before the process. P.S. Employee stock options are available.",
