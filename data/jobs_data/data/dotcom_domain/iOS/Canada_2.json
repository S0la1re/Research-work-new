It’s something about the iPhone look... the iPhone feel… the way your Apple Watch starts sending you heart rate alerts when your Xcode successfully compiles… or the limitless possibilities of SwiftUI, especially now that those medieval iPhone 6’s have been taken off life support.\n\nAs Transit’s newest iOS developer, you’ll be the swift-handed hero of millions of iPhone-wielders who don’t rely on a car to get around. You’ll help our team experiment, simplify, and perfect every aspect of the car-free commute: from our bodacious biking and subway maps, crowdsourced real-time displays, a devilishly simple step-by-step navigator, multimodal trip planner, and secret upcoming features you’ll discover once you’re hired.\n\nTransit is written in Objective-C and Swift, and the business logic is implemented in a C++ shared library – our iOS and Android teams work in tandem on that part of the codebase. The shared library allows us to reduce code duplication, while maintaining high standards by using UIKit and SwiftUI on iOS to build a UI that is familiar, native, and as smooth as Steve Jobs’ forehead.\n\nResponsibilities\n\nCollaborate with all-star teammates to dream up Transit’s next big feature.\n\nDevelop those features, refine existing ones, and maintain the iOS app with your tender love and care.\n\nRefactor and refine Transit’s architecture to make maintenance simpler to carry out, and new features more-easily integrated.\n\nConspire with our design team priests to bring their vision (and yours) to pixel-plated perfection.\n\n✅ Requirements\n\nYou're a self starter, adaptable and detail oriented.\n\nGood knowledge of Swift or Objective-C, plus UIKit or SwiftUI",
