Werk je graag bij een bedrijf waar 90% een IT-achtergrond heeft? En wil je op het gebied van iOS native development doorgroeien? Lees dan verder.\r\n\r\nRuim 8 jaar geleden zijn wij begonnen. Het begon allemaal nadat het product wat wij hadden ontwikkeld de wereldwijde markt veroverde. Van origine een IT-advies bureau maar uiteindelijk na de successen een spin-off van. Wij ontwikkelen nu door aan de techniek die het mogelijk maakt om gegevens uit te lezen van verschillende identiteitsbewijzen.\r\n\r\nVandaag de dag hebben wij ruim 40 mensen in dienst. Met het hoofdkantoor in Noord-Brabant werken wij continu door aan deze technologie die al door veel verschillende klanten wereldwijd wordt gebruikt. Denk aan grote financiële organen en ministeries. Ons product zorgt ervoor dat wereldwijd identiteitsfraude tegen wordt gegaan en dat er een veilige digitale omgeving bestaat voor sensitieve gegevens.\r\n\r\nMeer dan 90% van onze collega’s hebben een achtergrond in de richting van computer science, dat allemaal van verschillende niveaus. Aan kennis en kunde hebben wij hier geen gebrek. Werk jij graag aan maatschappelijk relevante oplossingen? Dan zit je hier goed.\r\n\r\nFunctie\r\n\r\nAls iOS developer kom je in ons iOS team terecht van momenteel 3 man groot, 2 senioren en 1 junior. Samen met ervaren collega’s werk je mee aan de techniek van de toekomst. Wij geloven dat samenwerking ervoor zorgt dat de kwaliteit van ons product wordt bevorderd. Daarom hanteren wij een open bedrijfscultuur waarbij iedereen met elkaar kan communiceren en iedereen als gelijke wordt gezien. Vandaar dat je dus ook vaak samenwerkt met collega’s van andere disciplines zoals het Android team.\r\n\r\nTijdens je werkzaamheden zul je vooral in de backend bezig zijn met het ontwikkelen van onze applicatie en het toevoegen van nieuwe functionaliteiten.

    "8. The order of keys in the output JSON MUST strictly follow the order of keys as they appear in the ALLOWED_KEYS section below. Only include keys that have at least one matched term. If a key has no matched terms, it MUST be completely omitted from the output, even if this breaks the visual continuity of the ALLOWED_KEYS order.\n",
