More specifically, a job is an activity, often regular and often performed in exchange for payment “for a living”Many people have multiple jobs e.g., parent, homemaker, and employee. A person can begin a job by becoming an employee, volunteering, starting a business, or becoming a parent. The duration of a job may range from temporary e.g., hourly odd jobs to a lifetime e.g., judges.\r\n\r\nAn activity that requires a person’s mental or physical effort is work as in “a day’s work”. If a person is trained for a certain type of job, they may have a profession. Typically, a job would be a subset of someone’s career. The two may differ in that one usually retires from their career, versus resignation or termination from a job.\r\n\r\nTypes of jobs\r\n\r\nJobs can be categorized, by the hours per week, into full time or part time. They can be categorized as temporary, odd jobs, seasonal, self-employment, consulting, or contract employment.\r\n\r\nJobs can be categorized as paid or unpaid. Examples of unpaid jobs include volunteer, homemaker, mentor, student, and sometimes intern.\r\n\r\nJobs can be categorized by the level of experience required: entry level, intern, and co-op.\r\n\r\nSome jobs require specific training or an academic degree.\r\n\r\nThose without paid full-time employment may be categorized as unemployed or underemployed if they are seeking a full-time paid job.\r\n\r\nMoonlighting is the practice of holding an additional job or jobs, often at night, in addition to one’s main job, usually to earn extra income. A person who moonlights may have little time left for sleep or leisure activities.\r\n\r\nThe Office for National Statistics in the United Kingdom lists 27,966 different job titles, within a website published 2015.",

The two may differ in that one usually retires from their career, versus resignation or termination from a job.\r\n\r\nTypes of jobs\r\n\r\nJobs can be categorized, by the hours per week, into full time or part time. They can be categorized as temporary, odd jobs, seasonal, self-employment, consulting, or contract employment.\r\n\r\nJobs can be categorized as paid or unpaid. Examples of unpaid jobs include volunteer, homemaker, mentor, student, and sometimes intern.\r\n\r\nJobs can be categorized by the level of experience required: entry level, intern, and co-op.\r\n\r\nSome jobs require specific training or an academic degree.\r\n\r\nThose without paid full-time employment may be categorized as unemployed or underemployed if they are seeking a full-time paid job.\r\n\r\nMoonlighting is the practice of holding an additional job or jobs, often at night, in addition to one’s main job, usually to earn extra income. A person who moonlights may have little time left for sleep or leisure activities.\r\n\r\nThe Office for National Statistics in the United Kingdom lists 27,966 different job titles, within a website published 2015.",

Der wichtigste Punkt ist allerdings die Begeisterungsfähigkeit und der Wille etwas von Anfang bis Ende durch zu ziehen.Also wenn du dich angesprochen fühlst, freue ich mich über Kontakt und ein gemeinsames Treffen.

Alongside this, I am studying Social Work. Now, I want to reorient myself and build something of my own online. After a lengthy ideation process, I have developed an idea that is worth implementing. I am highly committed and ready to put my full energy into a concept that I believe in.  \n\n**About the Idea:**  \nFirst of all: I don’t want to reinvent the wheel, and that’s not necessary. My idea is not about revolution but evolution. It builds on well-known concepts, reinterprets them, and implements new and attractive features. In simple terms, the idea is to combine popular online communication tools in a native app while bridging a gap between existing social networks. The offering is attractive because it is easily accessible, anonymous, clearly structured, and simple to use. Additionally, it enables quick and clear information exchange between users. More detailed information, including artworks and the features developed so far, will be shared in a personal meeting.  \n\n**What I’m Looking For:**  \nSince I am inexperienced in the technical implementation of a native application, I am looking for a co-founder who is inspired by my idea, willing to further develop it with me, and can contribute their technical expertise. However, the most important qualities are enthusiasm and the determination to see something through from start to finish.  \n\nIf this resonates with you, I look forward to hearing from you and meeting in person.

         "About us:\r\n\r\nRevenueCat makes building, analyzing, and growing mobile subscriptions easy. We launched as part of Y Combinator's summer 2018 batch and today are handling more than $4B of in-app purchases annually across thousands of apps.\r\n\r\nWe are a mission driven, remote-first company that is building the standard for mobile subscription infrastructure. Top apps like ChatGPT, VSCO, Notion, and ClassDojo count on RevenueCat to power their subscriptions at scale.\r\n\r\nOur 80 team members (and growing!) are located all over the world, from San Francisco to Madrid to Taipei. We're a close-knit, product-driven team, and we strive to live our core values: Customer Obsession, Always Be Shipping, Own It, and Balance.\r\n\r\nThe Role\r\n\r\nIf you’re looking to jumpstart your career in tech and have a direct impact on apps used by billions of end-users, the Developer Support Engineer (DSE) role at RevenueCat is a fantastic opportunity. This is one of the few entry-level positions we offer, and it has proven to be an incredible stepping stone—our current Support Lead, a Product Manager, and a Technical Account Manager each started out as DSEs.\r\n\r\nIn this role, you’ll help developers integrate the RevenueCat SDK into their apps, troubleshoot tricky edge cases, and unlock new possibilities in subscription monetization. You’ll provide hands-on support for some of the biggest apps in the world—imagine helping the teams behind ChatGPT, VSCO, PhotoRoom, Notion, and others get the best out of RevenueCat. You’ll be empowered to own the support experience, build out internal tools, and identify improvements that shape how developers everywhere use RevenueCat.\r\n\r\nIn 2024, our DSEs spoke at conferences in Berlin, Logroño, New York, London, and Tokyo. This is optional, but if you're interested, you can meet RevenueCat customers face to face, have fun working our booth, and share your knowledge with developers worldwide.\r\n\r\nWhat you’ll be responsible for\r\n• Supporting developers daily. You’ll debug issues, untangle complex code paths, and guide developers through onboarding so they can ship subscription features confidently.\r\n• Collaborating cross-functionally.

         "About us:\r\n\r\nRevenueCat makes building, analyzing, and growing mobile subscriptions easy. We launched as part of Y Combinator's summer 2018 batch and today are handling more than $4B of in-app purchases annually across thousands of apps.\r\n\r\nWe are a mission driven, remote-first company that is building the standard for mobile subscription infrastructure. Top apps like ChatGPT, VSCO, Notion, and ClassDojo count on RevenueCat to power their subscriptions at scale.\r\n\r\nOur 80 team members (and growing!) are located all over the world, from San Francisco to Madrid to Taipei. We're a close-knit, product-driven team, and we strive to live our core values: Customer Obsession, Always Be Shipping, Own It, and Balance.\r\n\r\nThe Role\r\n\r\nIf you’re looking to jumpstart your career in tech and have a direct impact on apps used by billions of end-users, the Developer Support Engineer (DSE) role at RevenueCat is a fantastic opportunity. This is one of the few entry-level positions we offer, and it has proven to be an incredible stepping stone—our current Support Lead, a Product Manager, and a Technical Account Manager each started out as DSEs.\r\n\r\nIn this role, you’ll help developers integrate the RevenueCat SDK into their apps, troubleshoot tricky edge cases, and unlock new possibilities in subscription monetization. You’ll provide hands-on support for some of the biggest apps in the world—imagine helping the teams behind ChatGPT, VSCO, PhotoRoom, Notion, and others get the best out of RevenueCat. You’ll be empowered to own the support experience, build out internal tools, and identify improvements that shape how developers everywhere use RevenueCat.\r\n\r\nIn 2024, our DSEs spoke at conferences in Berlin, Logroño, New York, London, and Tokyo. This is optional, but if you're interested, you can meet RevenueCat customers face to face, have fun working our booth, and share your knowledge with developers worldwide.\r\n\r\nWhat you’ll be responsible for\r\n• Supporting developers daily. You’ll debug issues, untangle complex code paths, and guide developers through onboarding so they can ship subscription features confidently.\r\n• Collaborating cross-functionally. You’ll partner closely with Engineering and Product to influence the developer experience—everything from our documentation to new features.\r\n• Building tooling and processes. You’ll craft or improve the internal apps and dashboards that make troubleshooting faster and easier, both for you and your teammates.\r\n• Driving user success.

We launched as part of Y Combinator's summer 2018 batch and today are handling more than $4B of in-app purchases annually across thousands of apps.\r\n\r\nWe are a mission driven, remote-first company that is building the standard for mobile subscription infrastructure. Top apps like ChatGPT, VSCO, Notion, and ClassDojo count on RevenueCat to power their subscriptions at scale.\r\n\r\nOur 80 team members (and growing!) are located all over the world, from San Francisco to Madrid to Taipei. We're a close-knit, product-driven team, and we strive to live our core values: Customer Obsession, Always Be Shipping, Own It, and Balance.\r\n\r\nThe Role\r\n\r\nIf you’re looking to jumpstart your career in tech and have a direct impact on apps used by billions of end-users, the Developer Support Engineer (DSE) role at RevenueCat is a fantastic opportunity. This is one of the few entry-level positions we offer, and it has proven to be an incredible stepping stone—our current Support Lead, a Product Manager, and a Technical Account Manager each started out as DSEs.\r\n\r\nIn this role, you’ll help developers integrate the RevenueCat SDK into their apps, troubleshoot tricky edge cases, and unlock new possibilities in subscription monetization. You’ll provide hands-on support for some of the biggest apps in the world—imagine helping the teams behind ChatGPT, VSCO, PhotoRoom, Notion, and others get the best out of RevenueCat. You’ll be empowered to own the support experience, build out internal tools, and identify improvements that shape how developers everywhere use RevenueCat.\r\n\r\nIn 2024, our DSEs spoke at conferences in Berlin, Logroño, New York, London, and Tokyo.

You’ll partner closely with Engineering and Product to influence the developer experience—everything from our documentation to new features.\r\n• Building tooling and processes. You’ll craft or improve the internal apps and dashboards that make troubleshooting faster and easier, both for you and your teammates.\r\n• Driving user success. From investigating stack traces to clarifying best practices, you’ll ensure developers can move from “blocked” to “shipped” without missing a beat.\r\n\r\nWithin your first month, you’ll:\r\n• Deep-dive into the frustrations and roadblocks developers face, helping them get unblocked so they can launch their apps.\r\n• Familiarize yourself with our support tools and processes.\r\n• Propose and implement quick wins in our documentation and support articles to reduce common developer pitfalls.\r\n• Work alongside our engineering team to resolve complex issues and learn the ins and outs of subscription infrastructure.\r\n\r\nWithin your first 3 months, you’ll:\r\n• Spot opportunities for product improvements that will reduce developer friction.\r\n• Build out test apps and reproducible environments to tackle issues head-on.\r\n• Own onboarding and solution engineering for new developers using RevenueCat, providing a seamless start-to-finish experience.\r\n\r\nWithin your first 6 months, you’ll:\r\n• Identify recurring blockers and implement targeted improvements—both in our products and in your own support workflows.\r\n• Craft (and refine) internal dashboards and tooling that accelerate the DSE team’s efficiency.\r\n• Make meaningful, self-directed contributions to how we scale support for an ever-growing developer community.\r\n\r\nAfter 12 months, you’ll have:\r\n• Gained super-hero level intuition for diagnosing the root causes of even the trickiest tickets.\r\n• Led the charge on hiring, mentoring, and growing our support engineering team.\r\n• Found new ways to delight developers, turning frustrating subscription problems into smooth, joyful experiences.\r\n\r\nAbout you\r\n• You’re eager to learn and grow; this is one of the few entry-level positions at RevenueCat and has historically launched multiple careers within our company.\r\n• You have 2-3 years of experience in an engineering or technical role, or have built and shipped a mobile app that integrates RevenueCat.\r\n• You’re comfortable with either iOS (Swift / Objective-C) or Android (Java / Kotlin) and have a grasp of app development and release processes.\r\n• You can debug code with minimal info, diagnosing issues from cryptic logs or stack traces.\r\n• You thrive in an environment that requires creative problem-solving and a “get it done” mentality.\r\n• You have strong written and verbal communication skills, and you’re empathetic towards the developer journey.\r\n\r\nWhat you’ll need to be successful\r\n• Technical curiosity and a willingness to learn new tools and frameworks.\r\n• Resourcefulness in figuring out solutions when the path isn’t obvious.\r\n• Clear communication skills to translate complex issues into helpful, actionable steps.\r\n• Outcome-oriented mindset, ensuring your support leads to measurable developer success—fewer tickets, better documentation, and happier customers.\r\n• Collaboration and comfort with a fully remote, asynchronous setup using tools like Slack, Zoom, Linear, and Notion.\r\n\r\nWhat we offer:\r\n• $112,000 USD Salary regardless of your location\r\n• Competitive equity in a fast-growing, Series B startup backed by top tier investors including Y Combinator\r\n• 10 year window to exercise vested equity options\r\n• Fully remote work environment that promotes autonomy and flexibility\r\n• Suggested 4 to 5 weeks time off to recharge and focus on mental, physical, and emotional health\r\n• $2,000 USD to build your personal workspace\r\n• $1,000 USD annual stipend for your continuous learning and growth\r\n\r\nCurious about the interview process?

We launched as part of Y Combinator's summer 2018 batch and today are handling more than $4B of in-app purchases annually across thousands of apps.\r\n\r\nWe are a mission driven, remote-first company that is building the standard for mobile subscription infrastructure. Top apps like ChatGPT, VSCO, Notion, and ClassDojo count on RevenueCat to power their subscriptions at scale.\r\n\r\nOur 80 team members (and growing!) are located all over the world, from San Francisco to Madrid to Taipei. We're a close-knit, product-driven team, and we strive to live our core values: Customer Obsession, Always Be Shipping, Own It, and Balance.\r\n\r\nThe Role\r\n\r\nIf you’re looking to jumpstart your career in tech and have a direct impact on apps used by billions of end-users, the Developer Support Engineer (DSE) role at RevenueCat is a fantastic opportunity. This is one of the few entry-level positions we offer, and it has proven to be an incredible stepping stone—our current Support Lead, a Product Manager, and a Technical Account Manager each started out as DSEs.\r\n\r\nIn this role, you’ll help developers integrate the RevenueCat SDK into their apps, troubleshoot tricky edge cases, and unlock new possibilities in subscription monetization. You’ll provide hands-on support for some of the biggest apps in the world—imagine helping the teams behind ChatGPT, VSCO, PhotoRoom, Notion, and others get the best out of RevenueCat. You’ll be empowered to own the support experience, build out internal tools, and identify improvements that shape how developers everywhere use RevenueCat.\r\n\r\nIn 2024, our DSEs spoke at conferences in Berlin, Logroño, New York, London, and Tokyo. This is optional, but if you're interested, you can meet RevenueCat customers face to face, have fun working our booth, and share your knowledge with developers worldwide.\r\n\r\nWhat you’ll be responsible for\r\n• Supporting developers daily. You’ll debug issues, untangle complex code paths, and guide developers through onboarding so they can ship subscription features confidently.\r\n• Collaborating cross-functionally. You’ll partner closely with Engineering and Product to influence the developer experience—everything from our documentation to new features.\r\n• Building tooling and processes. You’ll craft or improve the internal apps and dashboards that make troubleshooting faster and easier, both for you and your teammates.\r\n• Driving user success. From investigating stack traces to clarifying best practices, you’ll ensure developers can move from “blocked” to “shipped” without missing a beat.\r\n\r\nWithin your first month, you’ll:\r\n• Deep-dive into the frustrations and roadblocks developers face, helping them get unblocked so they can launch their apps.\r\n• Familiarize yourself with our support tools and processes.\r\n• Propose and implement quick wins in our documentation and support articles to reduce common developer pitfalls.\r\n• Work alongside our engineering team to resolve complex issues and learn the ins and outs of subscription infrastructure.\r\n\r\nWithin your first 3 months, you’ll:\r\n• Spot opportunities for product improvements that will reduce developer friction.\r\n• Build out test apps and reproducible environments to tackle issues head-on.\r\n• Own onboarding and solution engineering for new developers using RevenueCat, providing a seamless start-to-finish experience.\r\n\r\nWithin your first 6 months, you’ll:\r\n• Identify recurring blockers and implement targeted improvements—both in our products and in your own support workflows.\r\n• Craft (and refine) internal dashboards and tooling that accelerate the DSE team’s efficiency.\r\n• Make meaningful, self-directed contributions to how we scale support for an ever-growing developer community.\r\n\r\nAfter 12 months, you’ll have:\r\n• Gained super-hero level intuition for diagnosing the root causes of even the trickiest tickets.\r\n• Led the charge on hiring, mentoring, and growing our support engineering team.\r\n• Found new ways to delight developers, turning frustrating subscription problems into smooth, joyful experiences.\r\n\r\nAbout you\r\n• You’re eager to learn and grow; this is one of the few entry-level positions at RevenueCat and has historically launched multiple careers within our company.\r\n• You have 2-3 years of experience in an engineering or technical role, or have built and shipped a mobile app that integrates RevenueCat.\r\n• You’re comfortable with either iOS (Swift / Objective-C) or Android (Java / Kotlin) and have a grasp of app development and release processes.\r\n• You can debug code with minimal info, diagnosing issues from cryptic logs or stack traces.\r\n• You thrive in an environment that requires creative problem-solving and a “get it done” mentality.\r\n• You have strong written and verbal communication skills, and you’re empathetic towards the developer journey.\r\n\r\nWhat you’ll need to be successful\r\n• Technical curiosity and a willingness to learn new tools and frameworks.\r\n• Resourcefulness in figuring out solutions when the path isn’t obvious.\r\n• Clear communication skills to translate complex issues into helpful, actionable steps.\r\n• Outcome-oriented mindset, ensuring your support leads to measurable developer success—fewer tickets, better documentation, and happier customers.\r\n• Collaboration and comfort with a fully remote, asynchronous setup using tools like Slack, Zoom, Linear, and Notion.\r\n\r\nWhat we offer:\r\n• $112,000 USD Salary regardless of your location\r\n• Competitive equity in a fast-growing, Series B startup backed by top tier investors including Y Combinator\r\n• 10 year window to exercise vested equity options\r\n• Fully remote work environment that promotes autonomy and flexibility\r\n• Suggested 4 to 5 weeks time off to recharge and focus on mental, physical, and emotional health\r\n• $2,000 USD to build your personal workspace\r\n• $1,000 USD annual stipend for your continuous learning and growth\r\n\r\nCurious about the interview process?

We launched as part of Y Combinator's summer 2018 batch and today are handling more than $4B of in-app purchases annually across thousands of apps.\r\n\r\nWe are a mission driven, remote-first company that is building the standard for mobile subscription infrastructure. Top apps like ChatGPT, VSCO, Notion, and ClassDojo count on RevenueCat to power their subscriptions at scale.\r\n\r\nOur 80 team members (and growing!) are located all over the world, from San Francisco to Madrid to Taipei. We're a close-knit, product-driven team, and we strive to live our core values: Customer Obsession, Always Be Shipping, Own It, and Balance.\r\n\r\nThe Role\r\n\r\nIf you’re looking to jumpstart your career in tech and have a direct impact on apps used by billions of end-users, the Developer Support Engineer (DSE) role at RevenueCat is a fantastic opportunity. This is one of the few entry-level positions we offer, and it has proven to be an incredible stepping stone—our current Support Lead, a Product Manager, and a Technical Account Manager each started out as DSEs.\r\n\r\nIn this role, you’ll help developers integrate the RevenueCat SDK into their apps, troubleshoot tricky edge cases, and unlock new possibilities in subscription monetization. You’ll provide hands-on support for some of the biggest apps in the world—imagine helping the teams behind ChatGPT, VSCO, PhotoRoom, Notion, and others get the best out of RevenueCat. You’ll be empowered to own the support experience, build out internal tools, and identify improvements that shape how developers everywhere use RevenueCat.\r\n\r\nIn 2024, our DSEs spoke at conferences in Berlin, Logroño, New York, London, and Tokyo. This is optional, but if you're interested, you can meet RevenueCat customers face to face, have fun working our booth, and share your knowledge with developers worldwide.\r\n\r\nWhat you’ll be responsible for\r\n• Supporting developers daily. You’ll debug issues, untangle complex code paths, and guide developers through onboarding so they can ship subscription features confidently.\r\n• Collaborating cross-functionally. You’ll partner closely with Engineering and Product to influence the developer experience—everything from our documentation to new features.\r\n• Building tooling and processes. You’ll craft or improve the internal apps and dashboards that make troubleshooting faster and easier, both for you and your teammates.\r\n• Driving user success. From investigating stack traces to clarifying best practices, you’ll ensure developers can move from “blocked” to “shipped” without missing a beat.\r\n\r\nWithin your first month, you’ll:\r\n• Deep-dive into the frustrations and roadblocks developers face, helping them get unblocked so they can launch their apps.\r\n• Familiarize yourself with our support tools and processes.\r\n• Propose and implement quick wins in our documentation and support articles to reduce common developer pitfalls.\r\n• Work alongside our engineering team to resolve complex issues and learn the ins and outs of subscription infrastructure.\r\n\r\nWithin your first 3 months, you’ll:\r\n• Spot opportunities for product improvements that will reduce developer friction.\r\n• Build out test apps and reproducible environments to tackle issues head-on.\r\n• Own onboarding and solution engineering for new developers using RevenueCat, providing a seamless start-to-finish experience.\r\n\r\nWithin your first 6 months, you’ll:\r\n• Identify recurring blockers and implement targeted improvements—both in our products and in your own support workflows.\r\n• Craft (and refine) internal dashboards and tooling that accelerate the DSE team’s efficiency.\r\n• Make meaningful, self-directed contributions to how we scale support for an ever-growing developer community.\r\n\r\nAfter 12 months, you’ll have:\r\n• Gained super-hero level intuition for diagnosing the root causes of even the trickiest tickets.\r\n• Led the charge on hiring, mentoring, and growing our support engineering team.\r\n• Found new ways to delight developers, turning frustrating subscription problems into smooth, joyful experiences.\r\n\r\nAbout you\r\n• You’re eager to learn and grow; this is one of the few entry-level positions at RevenueCat and has historically launched multiple careers within our company.\r\n• You have 2-3 years of experience in an engineering or technical role, or have built and shipped a mobile app that integrates RevenueCat.\r\n• You’re comfortable with either iOS (Swift / Objective-C) or Android (Java / Kotlin) and have a grasp of app development and release processes.\r\n• You can debug code with minimal info, diagnosing issues from cryptic logs or stack traces.\r\n• You thrive in an environment that requires creative problem-solving and a “get it done” mentality.\r\n• You have strong written and verbal communication skills, and you’re empathetic towards the developer journey.\r\n\r\nWhat you’ll need to be successful\r\n• Technical curiosity and a willingness to learn new tools and frameworks.\r\n• Resourcefulness in figuring out solutions when the path isn’t obvious.\r\n• Clear communication skills to translate complex issues into helpful, actionable steps.\r\n• Outcome-oriented mindset, ensuring your support leads to measurable developer success—fewer tickets, better documentation, and happier customers.\r\n• Collaboration and comfort with a fully remote, asynchronous setup using tools like Slack, Zoom, Linear, and Notion.\r\n\r\nWhat we offer:\r\n• $112,000 USD Salary regardless of your location\r\n• Competitive equity in a fast-growing, Series B startup backed by top tier investors including Y Combinator\r\n• 10 year window to exercise vested equity options\r\n• Fully remote work environment that promotes autonomy and flexibility\r\n• Suggested 4 to 5 weeks time off to recharge and focus on mental, physical, and emotional health\r\n• $2,000 USD to build your personal workspace\r\n• $1,000 USD annual stipend for your continuous learning and growth\r\n\r\nCurious about the interview process?

         "**What does our IT team look like?**\n\nWe are not afraid of new technologies and strive to keep up with the latest versions. On Android, we build applications exclusively using Jetpack Compose, while on iOS, we are gradually transitioning to SwiftUI. Part of our work also includes regular time for refactoring and reducing technical debt, which helps us maintain high code and application quality.\n\n**What are we currently working on?**\n\nTogether, we are developing our e-shop mobile application, which is not just a poor sibling to the web solution. It is used by a significant percentage of our customers. The average rating of 4.8 and over 50,000 reviews across both platforms speak for themselves.\n\nWe were the first in the Czech Republic to implement Apple Pay and allow our customers to track Pilulka Auto during delivery, similar to tracking a taxi when ordering an Uber. Paying with Bitcoin is also a given with us.\n\nWhat other technological innovation will we come up with together?\n\nAdditionally, we have developers working on the development of our e-shop solution, internal back-office system (CRM, ERP), business intelligence, and vendor management system, primarily using PHP, JS, Python, and GoLang.\n\n**What do we expect from you - iOS?**\n- At least 2 years of experience in developing mobile applications for iOS\n- Excellent knowledge of the Swift programming language and XCode\n- You feel at home when working with UITableViews and UICollectionViews\n- Knowledge of SwiftUI is an advantage\n\nThe most important things for us are analytical thinking, a willingness to learn new things, and enthusiasm for work.\n\n**What do we expect from you - Android?**\n- At least 2 years of experience in developing mobile applications for Android\n- Excellent knowledge of Kotlin\n- Excellent knowledge of Android SDK\n- Good knowledge of Kotlin Flow\n- Good knowledge of Kotlin Coroutines\n- Good knowledge of MVVM architecture\n- Knowledge of Jetpack Compose is an advantage\n\nThe most important things for us are analytical thinking, a willingness to learn new things, and enthusiasm for work.\n\n**What else can we offer you?**\n- The possibility of partial remote work with occasional trips to the office; for us, the quality of work matters, not clocking in and out\n- An informal company culture\n- We value transparency, honesty, humanity, and quick, effective solutions. You can share your opinion openly with anyone in the company\n- Foreign language lessons - English, German, Spanish? :)\n- Contribution to a Multisport card\n- Offices just a few minutes' walk from the Palmovka or Českomoravská metro stations\n- Dog-friendly office\n- Every Tuesday, we prepare a bunch of fruit for breakfast\n- Company events (mountains, water sports, cultural activities, running races, and many other experiences) as well as IT team-building activities. Most recently, we visited the Trautenberk brewery and climbed Sněžka\n- Discounts on products from our range\n- We care about a well-balanced work-life balance because it’s a win-win for both sides\n\nIf you want to join us, get in touch or send us your LinkedIn profile.\n\nWe look forward to hearing from you :)",

We launched as part of Y Combinator's summer 2018 batch and today are handling more than $4B of in-app purchases annually across thousands of apps.\r\n\r\nWe are a mission driven, remote-first company that is building the standard for mobile subscription infrastructure. Top apps like ChatGPT, VSCO, Notion, and ClassDojo count on RevenueCat to power their subscriptions at scale.\r\n\r\nOur 80 team members (and growing!) are located all over the world, from San Francisco to Madrid to Taipei. We're a close-knit, product-driven team, and we strive to live our core values: Customer Obsession, Always Be Shipping, Own It, and Balance.\r\n\r\nThe Role\r\n\r\nIf you’re looking to jumpstart your career in tech and have a direct impact on apps used by billions of end-users, the Developer Support Engineer (DSE) role at RevenueCat is a fantastic opportunity. This is one of the few entry-level positions we offer, and it has proven to be an incredible stepping stone—our current Support Lead, a Product Manager, and a Technical Account Manager each started out as DSEs.\r\n\r\nIn this role, you’ll help developers integrate the RevenueCat SDK into their apps, troubleshoot tricky edge cases, and unlock new possibilities in subscription monetization. You’ll provide hands-on support for some of the biggest apps in the world—imagine helping the teams behind ChatGPT, VSCO, PhotoRoom, Notion, and others get the best out of RevenueCat. You’ll be empowered to own the support experience, build out internal tools, and identify improvements that shape how developers everywhere use RevenueCat.\r\n\r\nIn 2024, our DSEs spoke at conferences in Berlin, Logroño, New York, London, and Tokyo. This is optional, but if you're interested, you can meet RevenueCat customers face to face, have fun working our booth, and share your knowledge with developers worldwide.\r\n\r\nWhat you’ll be responsible for\r\n• Supporting developers daily. You’ll debug issues, untangle complex code paths, and guide developers through onboarding so they can ship subscription features confidently.\r\n• Collaborating cross-functionally. You’ll partner closely with Engineering and Product to influence the developer experience—everything from our documentation to new features.\r\n• Building tooling and processes. You’ll craft or improve the internal apps and dashboards that make troubleshooting faster and easier, both for you and your teammates.\r\n• Driving user success. From investigating stack traces to clarifying best practices, you’ll ensure developers can move from “blocked” to “shipped” without missing a beat.\r\n\r\nWithin your first month, you’ll:\r\n• Deep-dive into the frustrations and roadblocks developers face, helping them get unblocked so they can launch their apps.\r\n• Familiarize yourself with our support tools and processes.\r\n• Propose and implement quick wins in our documentation and support articles to reduce common developer pitfalls.\r\n• Work alongside our engineering team to resolve complex issues and learn the ins and outs of subscription infrastructure.\r\n\r\nWithin your first 3 months, you’ll:\r\n• Spot opportunities for product improvements that will reduce developer friction.\r\n• Build out test apps and reproducible environments to tackle issues head-on.\r\n• Own onboarding and solution engineering for new developers using RevenueCat, providing a seamless start-to-finish experience.\r\n\r\nWithin your first 6 months, you’ll:\r\n• Identify recurring blockers and implement targeted improvements—both in our products and in your own support workflows.\r\n• Craft (and refine) internal dashboards and tooling that accelerate the DSE team’s efficiency.\r\n• Make meaningful, self-directed contributions to how we scale support for an ever-growing developer community.\r\n\r\nAfter 12 months, you’ll have:\r\n• Gained super-hero level intuition for diagnosing the root causes of even the trickiest tickets.\r\n• Led the charge on hiring, mentoring, and growing our support engineering team.\r\n• Found new ways to delight developers, turning frustrating subscription problems into smooth, joyful experiences.\r\n\r\nAbout you\r\n• You’re eager to learn and grow; this is one of the few entry-level positions at RevenueCat and has historically launched multiple careers within our company.\r\n• You have 2-3 years of experience in an engineering or technical role, or have built and shipped a mobile app that integrates RevenueCat.\r\n• You’re comfortable with either iOS (Swift / Objective-C) or Android (Java / Kotlin) and have a grasp of app development and release processes.\r\n• You can debug code with minimal info, diagnosing issues from cryptic logs or stack traces.\r\n• You thrive in an environment that requires creative problem-solving and a “get it done” mentality.\r\n• You have strong written and verbal communication skills, and you’re empathetic towards the developer journey.\r\n\r\nWhat you’ll need to be successful\r\n• Technical curiosity and a willingness to learn new tools and frameworks.\r\n• Resourcefulness in figuring out solutions when the path isn’t obvious.\r\n• Clear communication skills to translate complex issues into helpful, actionable steps.\r\n• Outcome-oriented mindset, ensuring your support leads to measurable developer success—fewer tickets, better documentation, and happier customers.\r\n• Collaboration and comfort with a fully remote, asynchronous setup using tools like Slack, Zoom, Linear, and Notion.\r\n\r\nWhat we offer:\r\n• $112,000 USD Salary regardless of your location\r\n• Competitive equity in a fast-growing, Series B startup backed by top tier investors including Y Combinator\r\n• 10 year window to exercise vested equity options\r\n• Fully remote work environment that promotes autonomy and flexibility\r\n• Suggested 4 to 5 weeks time off to recharge and focus on mental, physical, and emotional health\r\n• $2,000 USD to build your personal workspace\r\n• $1,000 USD annual stipend for your continuous learning and growth\r\n\r\nCurious about the interview process?
