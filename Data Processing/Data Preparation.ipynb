         "A job, or occupation, is a person’s role in society. More specifically, a job is an activity, often regular and often performed in exchange for payment “for a living”Many people have multiple jobs e.g., parent, homemaker, and employee. A person can begin a job by becoming an employee, volunteering, starting a business, or becoming a parent. The duration of a job may range from temporary e.g., hourly odd jobs to a lifetime e.g., judges.\r\n\r\nAn activity that requires a person’s mental or physical effort is work as in “a day’s work”. If a person is trained for a certain type of job, they may have a profession. Typically, a job would be a subset of someone’s career. The two may differ in that one usually retires from their career, versus resignation or termination from a job.\r\n\r\nTypes of jobs\r\n\r\nJobs can be categorized, by the hours per week, into full time or part time.

Attraktiv ist das Angebot, weil es leicht zugänglich, anonym, klar strukturiert und einfach in der Handhabung ist. Zudem bietet es schnellen und übersichtlichen Informationsaustausch zwischen den Nutzern. Genauere Informationen inkl. Artworks und dem bisher erarbeiteteten Funktionsumfang gibts dann im persönlichen Kontakt.Was ich suche:Da ich selber sehr unerfahren in der technischen Umsetzung einer nativen Applikation bin, suche ich einen Mitgründer der sich von meiner Idee mitreißen lässt, bereit ist diese im gemeinsamen Prozess weiter zu entwickeln und sein technisches know how mit einbringt. Der wichtigste Punkt ist allerdings die Begeisterungsfähigkeit und der Wille etwas von Anfang bis Ende durch zu ziehen.Also wenn du dich angesprochen fühlst, freue ich mich über Kontakt und ein gemeinsames Treffen.

Alongside this, I am studying Social Work. Now, I want to reorient myself and build something of my own online. After a lengthy ideation process, I have developed an idea that is worth implementing. I am highly committed and ready to put my full energy into a concept that I believe in.  \n\n**About the Idea:**  \nFirst of all: I don’t want to reinvent the wheel, and that’s not necessary. My idea is not about revolution but evolution. It builds on well-known concepts, reinterprets them, and implements new and attractive features. In simple terms, the idea is to combine popular online communication tools in a native app while bridging a gap between existing social networks. The offering is attractive because it is easily accessible, anonymous, clearly structured, and simple to use. Additionally, it enables quick and clear information exchange between users. More detailed information, including artworks and the features developed so far, will be shared in a personal meeting.  \n\n**What I’m Looking For:**  \nSince I am inexperienced in the technical implementation of a native application, I am looking for a co-founder who is inspired by my idea, willing to further develop it with me, and can contribute their technical expertise. However, the most important qualities are enthusiasm and the determination to see something through from start to finish.  \n\nIf this resonates with you, I look forward to hearing from you and meeting in person.
