         "A job, or occupation, is a person’s role in society. More specifically, a job is an activity, often regular and often performed in exchange for payment “for a living”Many people have multiple jobs e.g., parent, homemaker, and employee. A person can begin a job by becoming an employee, volunteering, starting a business, or becoming a parent. The duration of a job may range from temporary e.g., hourly odd jobs to a lifetime e.g., judges.\r\n\r\nAn activity that requires a person’s mental or physical effort is work as in “a day’s work”.

Attraktiv ist das Angebot, weil es leicht zugänglich, anonym, klar strukturiert und einfach in der Handhabung ist. Zudem bietet es schnellen und übersichtlichen Informationsaustausch zwischen den Nutzern. Genauere Informationen inkl. Artworks und dem bisher erarbeiteteten Funktionsumfang gibts dann im persönlichen Kontakt.Was ich suche:Da ich selber sehr unerfahren in der technischen Umsetzung einer nativen Applikation bin, suche ich einen Mitgründer der sich von meiner Idee mitreißen lässt, bereit ist diese im gemeinsamen Prozess weiter zu entwickeln und sein technisches know how mit einbringt. Der wichtigste Punkt ist allerdings die Begeisterungsfähigkeit und der Wille etwas von Anfang bis Ende durch zu ziehen.Also wenn du dich angesprochen fühlst, freue ich mich über Kontakt und ein gemeinsames Treffen.

Alongside this, I am studying Social Work. Now, I want to reorient myself and build something of my own online. After a lengthy ideation process, I have developed an idea that is worth implementing. I am highly committed and ready to put my full energy into a concept that I believe in.  \n\n**About the Idea:**  \nFirst of all: I don’t want to reinvent the wheel, and that’s not necessary. My idea is not about revolution but evolution. It builds on well-known concepts, reinterprets them, and implements new and attractive features. In simple terms, the idea is to combine popular online communication tools in a native app while bridging a gap between existing social networks. The offering is attractive because it is easily accessible, anonymous, clearly structured, and simple to use. Additionally, it enables quick and clear information exchange between users. More detailed information, including artworks and the features developed so far, will be shared in a personal meeting.  \n\n**What I’m Looking For:**  \nSince I am inexperienced in the technical implementation of a native application, I am looking for a co-founder who is inspired by my idea, willing to further develop it with me, and can contribute their technical expertise. However, the most important qualities are enthusiasm and the determination to see something through from start to finish.  \n\nIf this resonates with you, I look forward to hearing from you and meeting in person.

If this sounds like an exciting challenge, we’d love to hear from you!\r\n\r\nWe are looking for a senior Kotlin Android developer to be part of the development of a brand new Golf app together with a team of senior Android and iOS developers. We have big ambitions for this new app and will be looking to add several multi-functional teams over the coming year as part of this scale-up so there will be lots of opportunities to have an impact and grow.\r\n\r\nYou will be working closely with developers working on the Trackman Golf app which is the gateway into the Trackman ecosystem and allows users to connect with others, find a Trackman golf simulator or driving range, enhance their golf practice through insightful data, and have fun with games by themselves or with others.\r\n\r\nIn the Trackman Mobile Golf Department we are more than 20 app developers building high-quality apps for our golf products. We build for iOS and Android and for phones and tablet. We work in several technologies, but with a shared passion for creating quality apps and user experiences.\r\n\r\nYou will join a team of skilled senior developers who love what they do and in a role where you will have an opportunity to have a big impact both on what is being built and how it is built. We value having our developers being part of the refinement early and you will be deeply involved in finding great solutions from a technical as well as a user perspective together with our product owners and UI/UX designers. We have a flat hierarchy and believe in building and shaping the product together, pushing ourselves to always improve, and having fun whilst doing it!\r\n\r\nWhat we're looking for\r\n\r\nWe look for an experienced candidate who is passionate about Android development and can be an active part of the open and creative atmosphere in the team and can take a lead on refining and implementing great features for our customers.\r\n\r\nYou likely have:\r\n• Demonstrated skills as an Android developer, ideally with significant Kotlin and Compose experience in a production environment.\r\n• More than 3 years experience, and have worked on building and maintaining an app over a longer period of time. We have millions of users using our apps and products, so experience with software at this scale is a plus.\r\n• Experience with Agile Development, Scrum, Unit Testing, Design Patterns, CI/CD and Continuous Integration is a big asset.\r\n• Kotlin Multi-platform is something we are experimenting with, so experience with this is a bonus.\r\n• The ability to work effectively within a team, communicating, and sharing knowledge along the way.\r\n\r\nWe are scaling up significantly so experience leading a team or having the ambition to do so is a plus. Some understanding of iOS development can also come in handy as you will be refining on features alongside developers working on the iOS version of the app you will work on. You work independently and have a willingness to share knowledge and continually develop your skill set. You probably have an educational background within computer science (or equivalent). If you play golf, that is a bonus, but not a requirement.\r\n\r\nThe Office\r\n\r\nWe offer a great office environment and facilities in our brand-new purpose-built Trackman Innovation Center, located at DTU Science Park in Hørsholm. We take great pride in the building we designed and built! The office features bright meeting rooms, coffee areas to catch up with colleagues, a large testing arena with simulators available for employees and a fitness center, everything surrounded by a beautiful forest and respecting the environment. We made sure to utilize the newest technologies to be energy efficient and be mindful of ventilation and sound propagation.\r\n\r\nThe cherry on top is our canteen: with indoor and outdoor areas to enjoy the fresh food prepared by our own kitchen staff.\r\n\r\nJoin the home of a powerful sports brand and a one-of-a-kind technology\r\n\r\nOur proprietary technology is based on expert knowledge about radar, computer vision, data, and software engineering. Our solutions are developed by specialists who endlessly explore and challenge new technical boundaries. Trackman’s blend of cutting-edge technology, sports, and continued growth make our company an outstanding place to work. Our work culture is entrepreneurial, ambitious, and rewarding as you get to collaborate with inspiring colleagues and interact with the leaders of golf, baseball, and football. Based on a unique brand reputation, we are proud to work in close partnership with the top athletes, organizations, and teams that rely on our technology to stay ahead of the race.\r\n\r\nWe are a Danish company founded, owned, and managed since 2003 by three entrepreneurs with a strong passion for sports. Today, we have a global footprint with our headquarters located in Denmark (Hørsholm) and offices in New York, Phoenix, Poland, and Tokyo. We employ over 700 people worldwide, half of which work in Denmark, where most hardware and software products are developed, tested, and manufactured.\r\n\r\nWhere innovation happens\r\n\r\nAt Trackman, we know that great people make great products. We believe that teams thrive, and innovation sparks in an atmosphere where people are encouraged to think for themselves, where everybody’s voices are heard, and where the best ideas prevail in the pursuit of exceptional solutions. This mix makes Trackman an inspiring company – for our customers and colleagues.\r\n\r\nShare our Passion!\r\n\r\nFor additional information about the position, please contact Head of Mobile Golf, Aske Robenhagen at aro@trackman.com.
