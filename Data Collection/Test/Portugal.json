That's why each team member gets €2,000 and 3 additional days to spend on professional development each year. Classes, conferences, books – your choice!\n\nRequirements\n\nYou’ll be successful in this role if you\n• Are highly self-driven, responsible and keen to learn and improve.\n• Love to develop awesome products with a focus on great user experiences.\n• Have 4+ years of professional experience with developing high quality production iOS apps.\n• Have 3+ years of professional experience in Swift development.\n• Love to work fullstack on native iOS apps.\n• Have a deep and up to date knowledge of iOS design principles and patterns, the core iOS frameworks and technologies.\n• Write code that's readable, well documented and meaningfully tested.\n• Are a great team player and communicator in a diverse and international remote team.\n\nNot sure if you meet all requirements above? Don't sweat it – if you think you're the right person anyway, we'd love to hear from you!\n\nBenefits\n\nCurious about how we work?\n• Core Communication time between 10 am - 3 pm (Berlin Time). We know people have different lifestyles, which is why we have flexible working hours with core time for synchronous interaction. You can organize your workday in the way that best suits you, your family, and your needs.\n• We work on a project basis in cross functional teams to ensure that we collaborate on our goals, move forward smoothly with open lines of communication, and achieve results as a team.\n• Every Monday morning, we have a whole-company presentation where you hear about projects across the business, inspire each other, and share great work.\n• We connect in person at three whole-company gatherings each year in beautiful locations. You can check out this playlist to find out more about how we stay close while being remote.\n• We use tools like Trello, Slack, Miro, Zoom, and Google Workspace on a daily basis to stay connected, collaborate easily, and manage projects.\n\nDive a little deeper and learn…\n• More about how we work here: How We Work\n• More about our recruitment process, salary and FAQs here: FAQs\n\nWe support diversity and inclusivity and welcome all prospective applicants.
