            "description": "Want to develop next-level mobile applications for our world-leading golf products together with a skilled team of developers?\n\nLooking to use your Android development skills and be part of building a brand new app from the ground up in a fast-paced and creative environment? If this sounds like an exciting challenge, we’d love to hear from you!\n\nWe are looking for a senior Kotlin Android developer to be part of the development of a brand new Golf app together with a team of senior Android and iOS developers. We have big ambitions for this new app and will be looking to add several multi-functional teams over the coming year as part of this scale-up so there will be lots of opportunities to have an impact and grow.\n\nYou will be working closely with developers working on the Trackman Golf app which is the gateway into the Trackman ecosystem and allows users to connect with others, find a Trackman golf simulator or driving range, enhance their golf practice through insightful data, and have fun with games by themselves or with others.\n\nIn the Trackman Mobile Golf Department we are more than 20 app developers building high-quality apps for our golf products. We build for iOS and Android and for phones and tablet. We work in several technologies, but with a shared passion for creating quality apps and user experiences.\n\nYou will join a team of skilled senior developers who love what they do and in a role where you will have an opportunity to have a big impact both on what is being built and how it is built. We value having our developers being part of the refinement early and you will be deeply involved in finding great solutions from a technical as well as a user perspective together with our product owners and UI/UX designers. We have a flat hierarchy and believe in building and shaping the product together, pushing ourselves to always improve, and having fun whilst doing it!\n\nRequirements\n\nWhat we're looking for\n\nWe look for an experienced candidate who is passionate about Android development and can be an active part of the open and creative atmosphere in the team and can take a lead on refining and implementing great features for our customers.\n\nYou likely have:\n• Demonstrated skills as an Android developer, ideally with significant Kotlin and Compose experience in a production environment.\n• More than 3 years experience, and have worked on building and maintaining an app over a longer period of time. We have millions of users using our apps and products, so experience with software at this scale is a plus.\n• Experience with Agile Development, Scrum, Unit Testing, Design Patterns, CI/CD and Continuous Integration is a big asset.\n• Kotlin Multi-platform is something we are experimenting with, so experience with this is a bonus.\n• The ability to work effectively within a team, communicating, and sharing knowledge along the way.\n\nWe are scaling up significantly so experience leading a team or having the ambition to do so is a plus. Some understanding of iOS development can also come in handy as you will be refining on features alongside developers working on the iOS version of the app you will work on. You work independently and have a willingness to share knowledge and continually develop your skill set. You probably have an educational background within computer science (or equivalent). If you play golf, that is a bonus, but not a requirement.\n\nThe Office\n\nWe offer a great office environment and facilities in our brand-new purpose-built Trackman Innovation Center, located at DTU Science Park in Hørsholm. We take great pride in the building we designed and built! The office features bright meeting rooms, coffee areas to catch up with colleagues, a large testing arena with simulators available for employees and a fitness center, everything surrounded by a beautiful forest and respecting the environment. We made sure to utilize the newest technologies to be energy efficient and be mindful of ventilation and sound propagation.\n\nThe cherry on top is our canteen: with indoor and outdoor areas to enjoy the fresh food prepared by our own kitchen staff.\n\nJoin the home of a powerful sports brand and a one-of-a-kind technology\n\nOur proprietary technology is based on expert knowledge about radar, computer vision, data, and software engineering. Our solutions are developed by specialists who endlessly explore and challenge new technical boundaries. Trackman’s blend of cutting-edge technology, sports, and continued growth make our company an outstanding place to work. Our work culture is entrepreneurial, ambitious, and rewarding as you get to collaborate with inspiring colleagues and interact with the leaders of golf, baseball, and football. Based on a unique brand reputation, we are proud to work in close partnership with the top athletes, organizations, and teams that rely on our technology to stay ahead of the race.\n\nWe are a Danish company founded, owned, and managed since 2003 by three entrepreneurs with a strong passion for sports. Today, we have a global footprint with our headquarters located in Denmark (Hørsholm) and offices in New York, Phoenix, Poland, and Tokyo. We employ over 700 people worldwide, half of which work in Denmark, where most hardware and software products are developed, tested, and manufactured.\n\nWhere innovation happens\n\nAt Trackman, we know that great people make great products. We believe that teams thrive, and innovation sparks in an atmosphere where people are encouraged to think for themselves, where everybody’s voices are heard, and where the best ideas prevail in the pursuit of exceptional solutions. This mix makes Trackman an inspiring company – for our customers and colleagues.\n\nShare our Passion!\n\nFor additional information about the position, please contact Head of Mobile Golf, Aske Robenhagen at aro@trackman.com. Applications are continuously assessed, so please send your application as soon as possible.\n\napply now",
