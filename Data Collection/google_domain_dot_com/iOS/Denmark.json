            "description": "Want to develop next-level mobile applications for our world-leading golf products together with a skilled team of developers?\n\nLooking to use your iOS development skills and be part of building a brand new app from the ground up in a fast-paced and creative environment? If this sounds like an exciting challenge, we’d love to hear from you!\n\nWe are looking for a senior iOS developer to be part of the development of a brand new Golf app together with a team of senior iOS and Android developers. We have big ambitions for this new app and will be looking to add several multi-functional teams over the coming year as part of this scale-up so there will be lots of opportunities to have an impact and grow.\n\nYou will be working closely with developers working on the Trackman Golf app which is the gateway into the Trackman ecosystem and allows users to connect with others, find a Trackman golf simulator or driving range, enhance their golf practice through insightful data, and have fun with games by themselves or with others.\n\nIn the Trackman Mobile Golf Department we are more than 20 app developers building high-quality apps for our golf products. We build for iOS and Android and for phones and tablet. We work in several technologies, but with a shared passion for creating quality apps and user experiences.\n\nYou will join a team of skilled senior developers who love what they do and in a role where you will have an opportunity to have a big impact both on what is being built and how it is built. We value having our developers being part of the refinement early and you will be deeply involved in finding great solutions from a technical as well as a user perspective together with our product owners and UI/UX designers.\n\nWe have a flat hierarchy and believe in building and shaping the product together, pushing ourselves to always improve, and having fun whilst doing it!\n\nWhat we're looking for\n\nWe look for an experienced candidate who is passionate about Android development and can be an active part of the open and creative atmosphere in the team and can take a lead on refining and implementing great features for our customers.\n\nYou likely have:\n• Demonstrated skills as an iOS developer, ideally with significant Swift and SwiftUI experience in a production environment.\n• More than 3 years experience, and have worked on building and maintaining an app over a longer period of time. We have millions of users using our apps and products, so experience with software at this scale is a plus.\n• Experience with Agile Development, Scrum, Unit Testing, Design Patterns, CI/CD and Continuous Integration is a big asset.\n• Kotlin Multi-platform is something we are experimenting with, so experience with this is a bonus.\n• The ability to work effectively within a team, communicating, and sharing knowledge along the way.\n\nWe are scaling up significantly so experience leading a team or having the ambition to do so is a plus.\nSome understanding of Android development can also come in handy as you will be refining on features alongside developers working on the Android version of the app you will work on.\nYou work independently and have a willingness to share knowledge and continually develop your skill set. You probably have an educational background within computer science (or equivalent). If you play golf, that is a bonus, but not a requirement.\n\nThe Office\n\nWe offer a great office environment and facilities in our brand-new purpose-built Trackman Innovation Center, located at DTU Science Park in Hørsholm. We take great pride in the building we designed and built!
