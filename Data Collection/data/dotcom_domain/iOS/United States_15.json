Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.\n\nAbout The Team\n\nWe believe that accepting payments and building checkout experiences in mobile apps could be much easier. We’ve solved part of the problem today with our Mobile Payment Element and other products in our SDKs, but our ambition is to go much further. For businesses, it’s still too hard to collect payments in every language, currency, payment method, and tax system, all while customizing the UI to fit their apps.\n\nMobile is an area of important investment for Stripe, and our mobile SDKs already power an incredible diversity of experiences for companies like DoorDash, Instacart, Urban Outfitters, Depop, and Kickstarter. We’re looking for an engineer with a solid understanding of the iOS platform to help define Stripe’s future on mobile.\n\nWhat you’ll do\n\nAs part of the Mobile Optimized Checkout Suite team, you’ll develop new payment APIs and checkout UI flows for iOS developers to include in their apps. One project could have you implementing a new local payment method to be made available for millions of customers, and the next could have you working to make our checkout experiences more customizable for some of your favorite apps. You’ll also help us continue to explore newer technologies like SwiftUI and Swift Concurrency as we iterate on better solutions for our users.\n\nResponsibilities\n• Design, build, and maintain the Stripe iOS SDK\n• Work with engineers, product managers, designers, and stakeholders across the company to bring new features and products to Stripe’s mobile SDKs\n• Stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends and advancements in iOS development and incorporate them into the SDK when appropriate\n• Collaborate with iOS developers who work on the Stripe mobile apps and Stripe Terminal to set best practices for iOS development across the company\n• Collaborate effectively in a remote-first work environment, maintaining open communication and strong connections with colleagues\n\nWho you are\n\nWe’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.\n\nMinimum Requirements\n• 1.5+ years of iOS development experience\n• Experience writing readable, maintainable, and testable code\n\nPreferred Qualifications\n• 2+ years of iOS development experience\n• Appreciate the art of API design\n• Experience collaborating on product and design requirements with stakeholders\n• (Bonus) Experience building mobile SDKs\n• (Bonus) Experience contributing to open-source libraries\n• (Bonus) Experience working in a remote-first environment\n\nHybrid work at Stripe\n\nOffice-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.\n\nPay and benefits\n\nThe annual US base salary range for this role is $150,500 - $225,700. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.\n\nAdditional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends.",
