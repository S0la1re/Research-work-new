This role is office based.\n\nRequirements\n\nWe're not hung up on education or qualifications. Yeah, we'll read it, but we're much more interested in what you've done.\n\nWe'd like to see some examples of your work. Specifically, apps you've worked on that are in the Play Store.\n\nWe want enthusiastic, motivated people who like to build apps and have a keen eye for UI/UX. Our projects are built with Kotlin and using the latest Jetpack Compose and Material Design Components. Experience in test driven development and managing CI/CD pipelines is a plus, but not necessary, you’ll have plenty of opportunity to learn as you go.\n\nWe use git for source control, YouTrack for bug tracking and TeamCity for continuous integration - But if you don't know these, we can help.\n\nDue to Tapadoo’s requirements for visa and work eligibility compliance in Ireland, we are only able to consider candidates who are EU/EEA citizens or those who have current visa and work permit. We are not considering relocation or sponsorship for this role.\n\nBenefits\n\nSalary will be in line with experience. Tapadoo offer a generous health plan to all employees upon completion of a probation period, and a generous company matched pension package too.\n\nHere's what we see as a major benefit:\n\nMobile apps are our core business. We eat, sleep and drink mobile apps. We're design led, and keep apace of what's going on in this industry. When you work at Tapadoo, you'll be able to showcase your efforts as they end up in the Play Store. Your contributions will be valued, and visible. You won't be \"the mobile app developer\" in a company whose core business is something completely different, left to work on a single app forever. Instead, you'll work on new and interesting projects on an ongoing basis.\n\nSo get in touchWe believe that a diverse team makes for better products and a better workplace. Our team come from all over the world and from a variety of backgrounds, cultures and life experiences. If you like the look of the job, but feel you don't meet all the requirements, feel free to drop us a mail at recruiting@tapadoo.com; We're happy to discuss the role and see if it may be a fit for you.\n\nApplicants please note that we are not considering relocation for this role.\n\nSorry Recruiters, we're not looking for help with this.",
