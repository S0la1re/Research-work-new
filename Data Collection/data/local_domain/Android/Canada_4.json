Turns out we were right.\n\nToday, our thinking is rooted in the belief that, in the age of unprecedented technology acceleration, maintaining a competitive advantage requires new strategies and a focus on innovation.\n\nOur approach has been to create a company designed to follow the talent, allowing us to amass an unfair share of hyper-skilled people who call Robots & Pencils home. A team of people who not only develop innovative solutions to transform businesses, but also create products that have been previously inconceivable.\n\nOur Core Values:\n• Strong Work Ethic\n• Top Drawer\n• Always Learning\n• Heart\n• Discipline\n• Efficacy\n• Together\n\nRobots & Pencils Offers:\n\nWe care about Talent.

How do we do this? Over the years we've hosted comedian shows, had holiday parties, happy hours, brunches with the CEO, surprise coffee runs for the team, health & wellness events and prizes, trivia nights, surprise dinners for R&P team members and their family and so much more! (And yes, we've prioritized a way to do these things in a virtual setting and not just in person - thank you Zoom!)\n\nResponsibilities:\n• Android App Development: Lead the development of robust, scalable, and high-performance Android applications using modern tools and technologies.\n• Architecture & Design: Collaborate with the team to define and implement app architecture, design patterns, and frameworks that deliver both performance and maintainability.\n• Cross-Team Collaboration: Work closely with product managers, UX/UI designers, and backend engineers to ensure smooth integration and delivery of quality features.\n• Code Quality & Reviews: Maintain high standards for code quality through code reviews, testing, and adherence to Android best practices.\n• Mentorship: Provide guidance and mentorship to junior and mid-level Android developers, helping them grow their technical skills and advance their careers.\n• Performance Optimization: Identify and resolve performance bottlenecks and improve the overall performance of Android apps, ensuring a smooth user experience.\n• Stay Current: Stay up-to-date with the latest trends, tools, and best practices in Android development and mobile technology.\n• Client-Facing Interaction: Occasionally engage with clients to translate business needs into technical solutions and provide technical insights throughout the project lifecycle.\n\nQualifications:\n• Experience: 5+ years of experience in Android development, with a strong portfolio of apps published on the Google Play Store.\n• Core Skills: Expert-level proficiency in Kotlin and Java, with a strong understanding of Android SDK, Jetpack libraries, and the Android ecosystem.\n• Architecture & Patterns: Experience with Android architecture patterns such as MVC, MVVM, Clean Architecture, and dependency injection (e.g., Dagger/Hilt).\n• APIs & Web Services: Experience integrating RESTful APIs and working with various data formats (JSON, XML) and networking protocols.\n• UI/UX Expertise: Deep knowledge of Android UI frameworks, Material Design principles, and responsive layout techniques for different screen sizes and devices.\n• Testing & CI/CD: Familiarity with Android testing frameworks (JUnit, Espresso, UI Automator) and experience with continuous integration/deployment (CI/CD) tools.\n• Mentorship & Collaboration: Proven experience in mentoring junior developers and collaborating effectively with cross-functional teams.\n• Problem Solving: Strong debugging skills and experience in diagnosing and solving performance, stability, and security issues.\n• Bonus: Experience with Kotlin Multiplatform, Flutter, or React Native, as well as prior work in a consulting or client-facing environment.",

We’re looking for a developer handy in C++ and Kotlin to improve Transit on Android. We’ve just started the migration from RxJava to Kotlin Flows, and we’re actively working on our first big Compose screen.\n\nWhile our iOS devs are busy on Notch Island dancing under a Lightning cable (or however else they spend their time) you’ll be optimizing our Android performance, developing better logic, and improving the C++ library shared by our iOS and Android apps. We work natively on Transit’s UI to keep it true to each platform, but there are lots of areas where we can reduce code duplication, making Transit as small and nimble as it can possibly be.\n\nWho are you? You know the ins-and-outs of the Android SDK like a Kotlin-savvy surgeon. The scariest episode of Fear Factor you’ve ever watched didn’t involve eating bugs — but refactoring bug-prone architecture. When your therapist asks what would make you happy, you say “a better Google Maps SDK” three times out loud.\n\nResponsibilities\n\nCollaborate with all-star teammates to dream up Transit’s next big feature.\n\nDevelop those features, refine existing ones, and maintain the Android app with your tender love and care.\n\nRefactor and refine Transit’s architecture to make maintenance simpler to carry out, and new features more-easily integrated.\n\nConspire with our design team priests to bring their vision (and yours) to pixel-plated perfection.\n\n✅ Requirements\n\nGood knowledge of Kotlin and C++.\n\nYou know your way around Android Studio and are detail oriented.\n\nConversational skills in French (and ideally, English).",
